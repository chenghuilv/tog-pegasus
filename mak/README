This directory contains *.mak files which comprise the Pegasus
build system.

The build system depends on three environment variables:

    PEGASUS_HOME - required (points to where executable directories will
        be placed; you can make this the same as the root of the source 
        distribution).

    PEGASUS_OS_TYPE - optional (defaults to windows; set to unix or windows).
