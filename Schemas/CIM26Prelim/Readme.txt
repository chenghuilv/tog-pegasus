CIM Schemas 2.6 - Preliminary

7 August 2001 - Created. KS

This directory contains the preliminary public release of the CIM schemas
version 2.6.

This version of the schemas will be required by Pegasus to allow for the
providers that manage the classes in the Interop schema.

8 August 2001 KS

NOTE: As of today, we have one fix to the schemas because there is an error
in the released version such that one class in events does not compile.

We had to change CIM_Indicationhandlercim-xml

to
CIM_IndicationHandlercimxml

There is a CR applied to this so that the offical version from DMTF is
expected to change to match.
