README - The Scehmas Directories

This directory contains  a set of subdirectories with the CIM MOF files
and the Makefile that installs a CIMSchema into the Pegasus Repository

The CIMOMxx directories are the official DMTF MOF files for the
versions of CIM defined by the xx (ex. CIM25 for CIM Schema version 2.5).

Preliminary versions of the CIM schemas should have the directory naming:

CIMPRELIMxx

The other directories are CIM MOF files for the Pegasus project
including Pegasus extensions and tests.

New CIM Schemas should be added to this directory each as a complete
subdirectory.

Please use the directory naming

CIMxx
orCIMPRELIMxx

where xx is the version

21 Feb 2002 - KS Added the Makefile for repository install to the
Schemas directory.  the version of the CIMSchema to install is
defined in that makefile.
