This directory contains the HTML CGI interface to Pegasus. It is used as part
of a demonstration of the Pegasus environment through a WEB browser


It consists of two subdirectories

htdocs - Contains the HTML forms that form the basis of the demonstration. The
starting point for the demo is index.html

cgi - This directory contains the CGI executables.  This consists of the
Pegasus CGIClient.exe program and supporting .DLLs.  We have placed them in
this directory despite the fact that they also exist in the PEGASUS_HOME/bin
directory to limit exposure to other executables through CGI and to avoid
having to have a permanent path the the $PEGASUS_HOME$/bin directory when
Apache is executing.

This demonstrations uses the HTML pages in htdocs as forms to generate CGI
requests through the WEB Server.  These requests are serviced by the Pegasus
CGIClient.exe program (copied to cgi-bin with the Makefile in this directory).
CGIClient, in turn converts the CGI forms input to Pegasus CIM Operations C++
calls. The Pegasus client library converts the calls to XML conformant with
the DMTF CIM Operations over HTTP defintions and passes them to the Pegasus
CIM Server.

The CIM server responses in XML are converted back to C++ responses at the CGI
client (part of the SDK code) and CGI client then make HTML pages out of the
responses and passes them back to the WEB server.

NOTE: Today, the Pegasus CIM server and the WEB server must be in the same
machine because CGIClient fixes the address and port of the CIM server as

	URL - localhost
	Port - 8888

This will be modified in the future.

To use this demonstration, you must  add definitions to your web server. For
example, in Apache, the following defintions in httpd.conf would word if the
%PEGASUS_ROOT% was D:/tog/pegasus.

    ScriptAlias /pegasus/cgi-bin "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/cgi-bin"
    Alias /pegasus/icons "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/icons"
    Alias /pegasus "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/htdocs"

    <Directory "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options ExecCGI
    allow from all
    </Directory>

To use the CGI interface, type "make" in this directory. Next run the
Server like this:

    C:\> Server <pegasus-run-directory>

    where <pegasus-run-directory> is required only if PEGASUS_HOME environment
    variable is not defined.

Then go to your browser and type in this URL:

    http://<yourhost>/pegasus

    Thus if the browser is on the same machine, enter localhost/pegasus

This demonstration can be used either locally or from a remote browser
