This directory contains the HTML CGI interface to Pegasus. It is used as part
of a demonstration of the Pegasus environment through a WEB browser


It consists of two subdirectories

htdocs - Contains the HTML forms that form the basis of the demonstration. The
starting point for the demo is index.html

cgi - This directory contains the CGI executables.  This consists of the
Pegasus CGIClient.exe program and supporting .DLLs.  We have placed them in
this directory despite the fact that they also exist in the PEGASUS_HOME/bin
directory to limit exposure to other executables through CGI and to avoid
having to have a permanent path the the $PEGASUS_HOME$/bin directory when
Apache is executing.

This demonstrations uses the HTML pages in htdocs as forms to generate CGI
requests through the WEB Server.  These requests are services by the Pegasus
CGIClient.exe program (located in cgi).   This program, in turn converts the
CGI forms input to Pegasus CIM Operations as Pegasus Client Operations and
passes them to the Pegasus CIM Server.

NOTE: Today, the Pegasus CIM server and the WEB server must be in the same
machine because CGIClient fixes the address and port of the CIM server as

	URL - localhost
	Port - 8888

This will be modified in the future.

To use this demonstration, you must have a you must add definitions to your
web server. For example, in Apace, the followingdefintions to httpd.conf would
workd if the %PEGASUS_ROOT% was D:/tog/pegasus.

    ScriptAlias /pegasus/cgi-bin "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/cgi-bin"
    Alias /pegasus/icons "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/icons"
    Alias /pegasus "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/htdocs"

    <Directory "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options ExecCGI
    allow from all
    </Directory>

To use the CGI interface, type "make" in this directory. Next run the
Server like this:

    C:\> Server <pegasus-run-directory>

    where <pegasus-run-directory> is required only if PEGASUS_HOME environment
    variable is not defined.

Then go to your browser and type in this URL:

    http://<yourhost>/pegasus

    Thus if the browser is on the same machine, enter localhost/pegasus

This demonstration can be used either locally or from a remote browser
