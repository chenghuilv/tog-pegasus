This directory contains the HTML CGI interface to Pegasus. To use it,
you must add definitions to your web server. For example, in Apace, I
added these defintions to httpd.conf:

    ScriptAlias /pegasus/cgi-bin "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/cgi-bin"
    Alias /pegasus/icons "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/icons"
    Alias /pegasus "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/htdocs"

    <Directory "D:/tog/pegasus/cgi/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options ExecCGI
    allow from all
    </Directory>
