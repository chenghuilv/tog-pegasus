    The <TT>createClass</TT> method creates a single CIM Class in
    the target Namespace. The Class MUST NOT already exist. The NewClass input
    parameter defines the new Class.  The proposed definition MUST be a correct
    Class definition according to the CIM specification.

    In processing the creation of the new Class, the following rules MUST be
    conformed to by the CIM Server:

    Any CLASSORIGIN and PROPAGATED attributes in the NewClass MUST be ignored by
    the Server. If the new Class has no Superclass, the NewClass parameter
    defines a new base Class. The Server MUST ensure that all Properties and
    Methods of the new Class have a CLASSORIGIN attribute whose value is the
    name of the new Class. If the new Class has a Superclass, the NewClass
    parameter defines a new Subclass of that Superclass. The Superclass MUST
    exist. The Server MUST ensure that:

    <UL>
        <LI>Any Properties, Methods or Qualifiers in the Subclass not defined in
        the Superclass are created as new elements of the Subclass. In
        particular the Server MUST set the CLASSORIGIN attribute on the new
        Properties and Methods to the name of the Subclass, and ensure that all
        other Properties and Methods preserve their CLASSORIGIN attribute value
        from that defined in the Superclass

        If a Property is defined in the Superclass and in the Subclass, the
        value assigned to that property in the Subclass (including NULL) becomes
        the default value of the property for the Subclass. If a Property or
        Method of the Superclass is not specified in the Subclass, then that
        Property or Method is inherited without modification by the Subclass

        <LI>Any Qualifiers defined in the Superclass with a TOSUBCLASS attribute
        value of true MUST appear in the resulting Subclass. Qualifiers in the
        Superclass with a TOSUBCLASS attribute value of false MUST NOT be
        propagated to the Subclass . Any Qualifier propagated from the
        Superclass cannot be modified in the Subclass if the OVERRIDABLE
        attribute of that Qualifier was set to false in the Superclass. It is a
        Client error to specify such a Qualifier in the NewClass with a
        different definition to that in the Superclass (where definition
        encompasses the name, type and flavor attribute settings of the
        <QUALIFIER> element, and the value of the Qualifier).
	</LI>
    </UL>

    @param NameSpace The NameSpace parameter is a string that defines the target
    namespace \Ref{NAMESPACE}

    @parm NewClass The NewClass input parameter defines the new Class.

    @return If successful, the specified Class MUST have been created by the CIM
    Server.

    If unsuccessful, one of the following status codes MUST be returned by this
    method, where the first applicable error in the list (starting with the
    first element of the list, and working down) is the error returned. Any
    additional method-specific interpretation of the error in is given in
    parentheses.
    <UL>
         <LI>CIM_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED
         <LI>CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED
         <LI>CIM_ERR_INVALID_NAMESPACE
         <LI>CIM_ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER (including missing, duplicate,
         unrecognized or otherwise incorrect parameters)
         <LI>CIM_ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS (the CIM Class already exists)
         <LI>CIM_ERR_INVALID_SUPERCLASS (the putative CIM Class declares a
         non-existent superclass)
         <LI>CIM_ERR_FAILED (some other unspecified error occurred)</LI>
