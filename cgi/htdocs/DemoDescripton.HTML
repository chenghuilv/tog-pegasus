	   This demonstration of the Pegasus implementation is based on using&nbsp; 
      <UL>
      <LI>HTML  and HTML page forms as the user interface.&nbsp;
      <LI>A WEB server to map the HTML input forms to a Pegasus CGI Client
      </UL>
      The WEB server contains a set of WEB pages representing
      the the CIM client requests. The WEB server then passes these to a program
      via CIG (CGIclient) that converts the parameters in these calls to Pegaus
      CIM Client calls which are passed to the Pegasus CIM server.
      <p>The responses from the CIM server are passed back to the CGI CIM Client
      and then converted to WEB pages for the user.<br>
