      <p><b>&nbsp;ADDDITIONAL Description of Fields</b>
    <hr>
    <p>Create Namespace is not an intrinsic CIM operation today.&nbsp; In
    accordance with the current CIM operations over HTTP specification, the
    creation of namespaces is executed instances of the class __Namespace. This
    class is defined with a single property, the name property which is the
    key.&nbsp; Creation of an instance of of this class causes a new namespace
    to be defined. If the namespace already exists, the create namespace returns
    the error CIM_ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS.</p>
    <p>NOTE: In the next version of CIM Operations over HTTP, the technique will
    be changed to allow for intrinsic methods that permit both creation an
    deletion of namespaces.</p>
    <p>In the&nbsp; Pegasus implementaiton, namespace manipulation is managed
    through a special provider __Namespace that is registered for the
    __Namespace class and returns creates and deletes namespaces as well as
    returning instances of __Namespace corresponding to the current set of
    namespaces.</p>
    <p><b>Return - </b>If successful, the return value defines the object path of the new
    CIM Instance relative to the target Namespace (i.e. the Model Path as
    defined by the CIM specification), created by the CIM Server.  It is
    returned in case one or more of the new keys of the Instance are allocated
    dynamically during the creation process rather than specified in the
    request.

    If unsuccessful, one of the following status codes MUST be returned by this
    method, where the first applicable error in the list (starting with the
    first element of the list, and working down) is the error returned. Any
    additional method-specific interpretation of the error in is given in
    parentheses.</p>

    <UL>
        <LI>CIM_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED
        <LI>CIM_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        <LI>CIM_ERR_INVALID_NAMESPACE
        <LI>CIM_ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER (including missing, duplicate,
        	unrecognized or otherwise incorrect parameters)
        <LI>CIM_ERR_INVALID_CLASS (the CIM Class of which this is to be a new
        	Instance does not exist)
        <LI>CIM_ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS (the CIM Instance already exists)
        <LI>CIM_ERR_FAILED (some other unspecified error occurred)
