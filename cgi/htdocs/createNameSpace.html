    /** The <TT>createInstance</TT> method creates a single CIM
    Instance in the target Namespace. The Instance MUST NOT already exist.

    In processing the creation of the new Instance, the following rules MUST be
    conformed to by the CIM Server:

    Any CLASSORIGIN and PROPAGATED attributes in the NewInstance MUST be ignored
    by the Server.

    The Server MUST ensure that:

    <UL>
        <LI>Any Qualifiers in the Instance not defined in the Class are created
        as new elements of the Instance.
        <LI>All Properties of the Instance preserve their CLASSORIGIN attribute
        value from that defined in the Class.
        <LI>If a CIMProperty is specified in the ModifiedInstance parameter, the
        value assigned to that property in the Instance (including NULL) becomes
        the value of the property for the Instance. Note that it is a Client
        error to specify a CIMProperty that does not belong to the Class.
        <LI>If a CIMProperty of the Class is not specified in the Instance, then
        that CIMProperty is inherited without modification by the Instance.
        <LI>Any Qualifiers defined in the Class with a TOINSTANCE attribute
        value of true appear in the Instance. Qualifiers in the
        Class with a TOINSTANCE attribute value of false MUST NOT be propagated
        to the Instance.
        <LI>Any CIMQualifier propagated from the Class cannot be modified in the
        Instance if the OVERRIDABLE attribute of that CIMQualifier was set to false
        in the Class. It is a Client error to specify such a CIMQualifier in the
        NewInstance with a different definition to that in the Class (where
        definition encompasses the name, type and flavor attribute settings of
        the <QUALIFIER> element, and the value of the CIMQualifier).
    </UL>

    @param NameSpace The NameSpace parameter is a string that defines the target
    namespace \Ref{NAMESPACE}&nbsp;
    <p>@param newInstance The <TT>newInstance</TT> input parameter defines the new
    Instance. The proposed definition MUST be a correct Instance definition for
    the underlying CIM Class according to the CIM specification.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>

    @return If successful, the return value defines the object path of the new
    CIM Instance relative to the target Namespace (i.e. the Model Path as
    defined by the CIM specification), created by the CIM Server.  It is
    returned in case one or more of the new keys of the Instance are allocated
    dynamically during the creation process rather than specified in the
    request.

    If unsuccessful, one of the following status codes MUST be returned by this
    method, where the first applicable error in the list (starting with the
    first element of the list, and working down) is the error returned. Any
    additional method-specific interpretation of the error in is given in
    parentheses.</p>

        	Instance does not exist)
