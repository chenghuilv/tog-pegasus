.SH NAME
cimmof \- compile MOF files into the CIM Repository 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcimmof \-h\fP
\fBcimmof\fP [ \fB-w\fP ] [ \fB-I\fP <path> ] [ \fB-n\fP <namespace> ] <file>...<file>
.SS Remarks
.PP
Only a superuser or user with write access to the default or specified 
namespace can run the 
.B cimmof
command to compile MOFs in the CIM Repository.
.PP
Superclasses must be compiled before subclasses, else the compile will fail.
.PP
It is strongly recommended that MOF files include all necessary subclasses,
so they can compile properly even if certain classes are not in the CIM 
Repository.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The 
.B cimmof
command is the command line interface to the Managed
Object Format (MOF) Compiler.  The MOF Compiler is a utility that
compiles MOF files (using the MOF format defined by the DMTF CIM
Specification) into CIM classes and instances that are stored
in the CIM Repository.
.PP
The 
.B cimmof
command can be used to compile MOF files at any time after installation.
If no input file is specified, stdin is used as the input.
.PP
The MOF Compiler requires that the input MOF files be in the current
directory or that a fully qualified path be given.  To simplify the
specification of multiple MOF files in the 
.B cimmof
command line, the MOF Compiler allows compiling from files containing a list of
MOF files using the include pragma (as shown below).
.RS
.TP
.PD 0
.B "#pragma include (""application.mof"")"
.TP
.B "#pragma include (""server.mof"")"
.PD
.RE
.PP
MOF files using the include pragma must be in the current directory
or in a directory specified by the 
.B \-I
command line option.
.PP
The 
.B \-n
option can be used to specify a 
.IR namespace 
in which the CIM classes and instances will be compiled.  If this option is not
specified, the default 
.IR namespace 
is root/cimv2 (with the exception of provider registration schemas).  
.PP
For provider registration schemas, if the 
.B \-n
option is not
specified, the default 
.IR namespace 
is root/PG_InterOp.  If 
.B \-n
option is specified, the 
.IR namespace 
specified must be root/PG_InterOp, otherwise, the error message "The 
requested operation is not supported." is returned.   For provider
MOFs, the 
.IR namespace 
specified must match one of the namespaces specified
in the PG_ProviderCapabilities class schema definition. 
.SS Options
The 
.B cimmof
command recognizes the following options:
.RS
.TP 15
.B -h
Display the command usage and the version number of the MOF Compiler.
The version number is used to identify the release version of the
MOF Compiler in the HP WBEM Services product.
.TP
.B -w
Suppress warning messages. 
.IP
When compiling the MOF files, if there are CIM elements (such as classes,
instances, properties, or methods) defined in the MOF files which 
already exist in the CIM Repository, the 
.B cimmof
command returns warning messages.  The 
.B \-w
option can be used to suppress these warning messages.
.TP
\fB-I\fP <path>
Specify the path to included MOF files.  This path may be relative or
absolute.
.IP
If the input MOF file has include pragmas and the
included files do not reside in the current directory,
the 
.C -I
directive must be used to specify a path to
them on the 
.B cimmof
command line.
.TP
\fB-n\fP <namespace>
Override the default CIM Repository namespace. The
.I <namespace> 
specified  must be a valid CIM
namespace name.  For the definition of a valid CIM
namespace name, refer to the Administrator's Guide.
For provider registration schemas, the 
.I <namepace>
specified must be root/PG_InterOp.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
The 
.B cimmof
command returns one of the following values:
.RS
.TP
.B 0
Successful completion
.PD 0
.TP
.B 1 
Error
.PD
.RE
.PP
When an error occurs, an error message is written to stderr and an
error value of 1 is returned.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
.B "Error trying to create Repository in path localhost:5988: Cannot connect to: localhost:5988 Failed to set DefaultNamespacePath."
.IP
The CIM Server is not running.  Start the CIM Server with the
.C cimserver 
command and re-run
.B cimmof .
.PP
If the MOF Compiler detects an error in the MOF file while parsing the file, 
a parsing error is returned with the line number of the MOF file containing
the error.
.PP
.B "Operation cannot be carried out since the specified superclass does not exist." 
.IP
The MOF Compiler compiled a MOF file with superclasses that were not
in the CIM Repository.
.PP
For a list of possible error messages
that may be returned, refer to the Chapter on WBEM messages in
the Administrator's Guide.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Compile a MOF file into the default namespace in the CIM Repository,
issue the 
.B cimmof
command with no options.
.IP
.B "cimmof processInfo.mof"
.PP
Compile the MOF files into the 'root/application' namespace.
.IP
.C "cimmof -nroot/application test1.mof test2.mof"
.PP
Compile the MOF file defined in the directory ./MOF with the name
CIMSchema25.mof, and containing include pragmas for other MOF files also
in the ./MOF directory.
.IP
.B "cimmof -w -I./MOF MOF/CIMSchema25.mof"
.PP
List the arguments to the 
.B cimmof
command and display the version of the MOF Compiler.  
.IP
.B "cimmof -h"
