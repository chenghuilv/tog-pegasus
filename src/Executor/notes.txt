    1.  The user that runs cimervermain is determined as follows.

        (1) Look for serverUser configuration option on command line.

        (2) Look for serverUser configuration option in planned configuration
            file.

        (3) Use the owner of the cimservermain program (if not root).

        (4) Use "pegasus" (the default user).

    2.  All files but the repository are owned by root. The cimservermain
        process may read any of the root owned files, but it must ask the
        executor to modify the file system.

    3.  Cimservermain must own the repository and all files beneath.
        The executor automatically sets ownership for these files upon
        startup.

    4.  Provider agent is run as root, whenever the same user as server is
        requested.
    
    5.  Executor checks whether Pegasus repository exists and errors out
        if not.

    7.  Cimservermain owns the local-domain socket file (/tmp/cimxml.socket).

    8.  For logging purposes, the executor uses "cimexecutor" as its syslog
        identifier.
