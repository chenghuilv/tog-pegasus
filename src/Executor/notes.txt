    1.  Cimservermain must be owned by ordinary user. For example:

        % chown pegasus.pegasus cimservermain

        Cimservermain runs as this user.

    2.  Cimservermain must be able to create files directly under $PEGASUS_HOME.

        For example, it must create the cimserver.password file.

        We solved this by having the executor access those files.

    3.  Cimservermain must own $PEGASUS_HOME/repository and all files beneath.

        For now, the executor automatically sets ownership for these files.

    4.  For OOP run with same user as server, what user is that? The
        cimservermain user or root? The intent was probably to run those
        providers with privilege.

        For now, we use the same user as the executor.

    5.  Executor now checks whether Pegasus repository exists and errors out
        if not. Is this okay?

    6.  The configuration file has a repositoryDir key. What is that for and
        does it mean that the executor cannot reliably locate the repository
        with the constant in Constants.h?

    7.  Cimservermain owns the local-domain socket file.

    8.  For logging purposes, the executor uses "cimexecutor" as its syslog
        identifier.
