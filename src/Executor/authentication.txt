Authentication mechanisms in Pegasus:

    SecureLocal - uses secrets file (e.g., /tmp/cimclient_jsmith_99_1235).

        Implemented by SecureLocalAuthenticator.h

        Present always.

        HTTP AuthType is "Local"

    PAMBasic - uses PAM module authentication (in-process and out-of-process).

        Implemented by PAMBasicAuthenticator.h

        Present with defined(PEGASUS_PAM_AUTHENTICATION)

        HTTP AuthType is "Basic"

    SecureBasic - uses cimserver.passwd file.

        Implemented by SecureBasicAuthenticator.h

        Present with !defined(PEGASUS_PAM_AUTHENTICATION)

        HTTP AuthType is "Basic"

    Kerberos - not available to Pegasus (implementation is proprietary).

        Implemented by KerberosAuthenticationHandler.h (unavailable).

        Present when compiling with PEGASUS_KERBEROS_AUTHENTICATION flag.

    SSL - uses client certificates stored in trust store.

        Implemented in Common library.

        Never present (since code is not part of Pegasus).

        Pegasus has no client-side support for this authentication type.

        The server-side support is only enabled on zOS.
