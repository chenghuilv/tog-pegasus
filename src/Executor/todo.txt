    (A) Generate and use "indication service session key". What user should
        the key be created for?

    (A) Implement policy.

    BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB

    (B) Handle shutdownTimeout option in cimshutdown (pass it as command 
        line argument).

    (B) Test without privilege separation.

    (B) Test on Windows.

    (C) Generate provider policy file automatically from repository.

    (C) Rethink "run as CIM server" policy when starting provider agents.
        Currently, this means run as the same user as the executor (this
        preserves the old behavior).

    (C) Consider implementing rotating one-shot session keys.

    (C) Propose pre-check utility that verifies proper file ownership (e.g.,
        private key must be owned by root, all other files must be owned
        by root but not writable by anyone else). Perhaps the executor could
        perform these checks and print warnings.

    (C) Consider implementing standard Unix password file checking for
        AUTHENTICATE_PASSOWRD and VALIDATE_USER commands.

    (C) Estimate effort of moving SSL certificate authentication to executor.
