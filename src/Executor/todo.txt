    (B) Update readme.privsep

    (B) Revalidation (all configurations and all platforms).

    (B) Code walk-through of all diffs to cimservermain.

    (B) Take out CLI.cpp changes.

    (B) Deal with ATTN's and MEB's.

    (C) cimserver -h does not work if server is already running.

    (C) Change Executor class to use String rather than char*.

    (C) Remove Backtrace.* files.

    (C) Eliminate AnonymousPipe::setSessionKey() and getSessionKey(). Put 
        session key into ProviderAgentContainer.

    (C) Add Strlcat and Strlcpy unit tests to Pegasus build.

    (C) Clean up log messages.

    (C) Generate provider policy file automatically from repository.

    (C) Rethink "run as CIM server" policy when starting provider agents.
        Currently, this means run as the same user as the executor (this
        preserves the old behavior). Changing it to use the cimservermain
        user will most likely break existing providers, which were probably
        written with the expectation of running as root.

        Should we consider deprecating this option?

    (C) Consider implementing rotating one-shot session keys.

    (C) Propose pre-check utility that verifies proper file ownership (e.g.,
        private key must be owned by root, all other files must be owned
        by root but not writable by anyone else). Perhaps the executor could
        perform these checks and print warnings.

    (C) Consider implementing standard Unix password file checking for
        AUTHENTICATE_PASSOWRD and VALIDATE_USER commands.

    (C) Estimate effort of moving SSL certificate authentication to executor.
