    (A) Generate and use "indication service session key". What user should
        the key be created for?

    (A) Delete unused session keys.

    (A) Implement policy.

    (A) Rework so that PG_ProviderModule.userContext=5 (CIM server) causes
        provider agent to run as server user (fix related tests).

    (B) Add PEGASUS_SERVER_USER (default "pegasus") to Constants.h and remove
        serverUser configuration parameter. Also remove logic which deduces
        the user from the cimservermain program owner.

    (B) Rename WAIT_PID request to REAP_PROVIDER_AGENT. Use session key to
        wait on it.

    (B) Handle shutdownTimeout option in cimshutdown (pass it as command 
        line argument).

    (B) Test without privilege separation.

    (B) Test on Windows.

    (B) Demote most INFORMATION log messages to TRACE.

    (C) Generate provider policy file automatically from repository.

    (C) Consider implementing rotating one-shot session keys.

    (C) Propose precheck program that verifies proper file ownership (e.g.,
        private key must be owned by root, all other files must be owned
        by root but not writable by anyone else).

    (C) Consider implementing standard Unix password file checking for
        AUTHENTICATE_PASSOWRD and VALIDATE_USER commands.

    (C) Estimate effort of moving SSL certificate authentication to executor.
