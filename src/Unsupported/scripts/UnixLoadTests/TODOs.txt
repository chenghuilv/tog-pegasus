There are a number of TODOs for these tests including:

1. Integrate them so that a single script would start and run the test.
2. Add a mechanism to do indication load testing either with these scripts
   or a separate script
3. Improve the CIMServer statistics reporting so that it is easier to see
   what the cimserver is actually doing.  See bug 9962 for work in that
   area.
 
Please feel free to add more TODOs to this list.
