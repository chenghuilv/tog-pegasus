SOURCE CODE ORGANIZATION
==========================

The source code is organized as follows:

Initial directory = ldap_slp
+---conf                     <-- contains the DA configuration file 
+---doc                      <-- contains some internet-drafts
+---src                      <-- source code
|   +---cmd-utils            <-- command-line utilities
|   |   +---slp_client       <-- slp client library
|   |   +---slp_query        <-- command-line slp user agent 
|   |   +---slp_srvreg       <-- command-line and daemon slp service agent
|   +---kernel               <-- slp directory agent (daemon)


BUILD REQUIREMENTS
===========================

To build the source tree, you must have Bash, Gnu Make, Gnu Autoconf,
and Gnu Libtool, and a C compiler and linker. 


BUILD COMMANDS
===========================

1) Untar distribution tarball and cd into the ldap_slp directory. 
2) type ./configure DEBUG=TRUE <Enter>
3) type make <Enter>

Binaries will be located in the same directories as thier source. The
mysterious machinations of libtool allow you to link and run binaries
against the libslp_client.so shared library without actually
installing anything. 

To clean all the binaries, type make clean <Enter>


INSTALLATION
===========================

To install, su to root and type make install <Enter>

Currently make install only works for the cmd-utils directory tree. 
This allows you to install the shared library, SA (slp_srvreg), and UA
(slp_query) tools. 

To install the DA, simply copy it to a directory in your search
path. Ensure that the configuration file (slp.conf) is in a known
location and use the -f command-line parameter to load the
configuratin file. e.g., 

lslp-kernel -f/etc/slp.conf
