CMD-UTILS
===========
The cmd-utils directory contains a general purpose client library,
plus two command-line programs designed to be used with Bash or
Perl. The library contains all the features of an SLP client, and the
two programs use the library to implement an SLP Service Agent and an
SLP User Agent


State of the Source Tree
=======================
As of Mon May 12 2003 the Windows build is broken. The Linux build is
working on at least two linux platforms. 

The source tree has undergone significant reorgination lately. I have
converted from really ugly kludged makefiles to using the GNU autoconf
and libtool programs to organize and control the building
process. (Some of you may think that autoconf is really ugly and
kludged but considering all of the problems it solves I would have to
disagree.) 

Here is how the source tree is now organized:

Initial directory = ldap_slp
+---conf                     <-- contains the DA configuration file 
+---doc                      <-- contains some internet-drafts
+---src                      <-- source code
|   +---cmd-utils            <-- command-line utilities
|   |   +---slp_client       <-- slp client library
|   |   +---slp_query        <-- command-line slp user agent 
|   |   +---slp_srvreg       <-- command-line and daemon slp service agent


Windows Build
=============
The Windows build is broken because I haven't debugged the autoconf
macros for windows. If you are curious, look at the file
ldap_slp/configure.ac. 

When windows builds once again it will require Bash, gmake, and GNU
Autoconf and Libtool. The best thing to do if you want to build on
windows and don't know what I'm talking about is to get Cygwin. You
can get Cygwin at http://www.cygwin.com


Porting
=========
Porting this code to any POSIX operating system is straightforward. 
Each operating system needs to have its own compatibility source
modules. For linux, those are lslp-linux.h and lslp-linux.c

To add support for a new platform, you must start with the autoconf
script, configure.ac. In that script there are placeholders for each
platform. Here is a sample that implements part of the linux support: 

  *-*-linux*)
	AC_DEFINE([HOST_OS], ["Linux"], [Target Operation System])
	AC_DEFINE([OS_PORT_INCLUDE], ["lslp-linux.h"], [Portability Header])
	OS_PORT_INC=lslp-linux.h
	OS_PORT_SRC=lslp-linux.c
	OS_PORT_OBJ=lslp-linux.lo

Each of these symbols has a counterpart within the build system. For a
new platform you need to flesh out the placeholder for that platform
in configure.ac. Then you need to implement the portability header and
possibly a portability source file.

Unfortunatly, the cmd-utils and kernel directory structures each have
their own compatibility headers. That means there is one
"lslp-linux.h" for the DA build and a totally separate version of the
same file for the cmd-utils build. This is historical and I intend to
clean it up. However, the DA is quite a bit more sophisticated than
the cmd-utils so its compatibility files are more complicated. So it
is not just a total duplication of code. 

If you are only interested in the DA (lslp-kernel) or the SA
(cmd-utils) but not both then you can choose to only implement one
version of the compatibility files. The SA version is not as much
work.
