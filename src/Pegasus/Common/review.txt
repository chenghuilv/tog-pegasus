NOTES/QUESTIONS:
================

    1.	Why do we need CIMOMHandle and CIMHandle?

    2.  Lots of warnings like this:

	warning C4101: 'e' : unreferenced local variable

    3.	DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES variable differences should be taken care of
	in mak system (not in individual makefiles; see Client/Makefile).

    4.	Use Linkage.h style everywhere.

    5.	Rename Provider2 to Provider

    6.	WBEMEXEC relies on old obsolete libraries (which have been removed).

    7.	Don't use System class directly.

    8. 	Reconcile all the queues (DQueue, MT_MessageQueue, MessageQueue, etc.).

-     MT_MessageQueue is not used

    DQueue and MessageQueue are significantly different and are both needed in Pegasus. 
    
    DQueue is a series of doubly-linked list containers that range from unlocked 
    void * containers to template classes with conditional locks and capacity controls. 
    The differences between the DQueue classes and the MessageQueue class are as follows:

 -    DQueue is a doubly-linked list container heirarchy
 -    DQueue is a container that can managed many different types of objects. 
 -    Contained objects do not need to be aware that they are contained by DQueue.
 -    Contained objects do not need to inherit from a base class.  
 -    DQueue supports traversing of the list and referring to the contained 
      objects while expecting contention; i.e., requires all traversals and 
      referrals to be done only by the owner of the queue mutex or condition
-     There is no central registry of DQueue objects, and DQueue objects are not named

DQueue and its base class is used heavily throughout the thread and ipc classes, 
and in other places where lists of objects are subject to heavy access contention.
