NOTES/QUESTIONS:
================

    1.	Why do we need CIMOMHandle and CIMHandle?

    2.  Lots of warnings like this:

	warning C4101: 'e' : unreferenced local variable

    3.	DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES variable differences should be taken care of
	in mak system (not in individual makefiles; see Client/Makefile).

    4.	Use Linkage.h style everywhere.

    5.	Rename Provider2 to Provider

    6.	WBEMEXEC relies on old obsolete libraries (which have been removed).

    7.	Don't use System class directly.

    8. 	Reconcile all the queues (DQueue, MT_MessageQueue, MessageQueue, etc.).
