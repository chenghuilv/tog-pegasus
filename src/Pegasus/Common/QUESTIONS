    1.	Can properties inherit qualifiers from the superclass?

    2.	Consider the qualifier-list of a property. Are the propagated
	flags wrong on these qualifiers when a property is propagated
	from a superclass to a subclass.

    3.	Should the setXXX() method be removed from all the objects:

	    Parameter::setName()

    4.	Should the setValue() method throw an exception if there is
    	an attempt to change the type?
