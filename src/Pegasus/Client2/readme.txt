This directory is temporary for testing changes to the client library
during interoperability testing.  When the testing is complete, the
decision will be made about merging changes back into the main
Pegasus client functions.

Note: This directory is compiled only when the env variable
PEGASUS_SNIA_INTEROP_TEST is set.

We expect to merge this into client dir and eliminate this directory
about 7 october 2002
