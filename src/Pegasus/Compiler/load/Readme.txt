This directory provides a way to load schemas into the repository.
It includes only a make file that provides the standard schema load into
the repository

ATTN: KS This work should be moved elsewhere. Originally this was created as
a test tool but this Makefile is now the default repository loader.  The
logical location for this file is probably the the schema directory.
