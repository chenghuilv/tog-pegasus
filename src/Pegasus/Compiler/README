The mof compiler is a long ways from done, but it does
build and populate a repository.

Build instructions

  cd Pegasus/getoopt
  make
  cd ../Common
  make
  cd ../Repository
  make
  cd ../Compiler
  make
  cd cmdline
  make

It will be integrated in Mike's make system shortly.
It should build on NT with MSVC++ version 6 (I haven't tried version 5)
and on Linux with gcc 2.95.  On my machines, it successfully compiles
CIM_Schema25.mof in about 50 seconds on NT and about 15 on Linux.

Partial list of to-do's:
  - Add command line arguments to control over-laying of existing objects,
    stopping the addition of new base classes and several other things.
  - Make the command line driver turn off logging in the embeddable
    compiler code.  Right now, errors print out twice.
  - Handle a few  errors that are ignored now.
  - bunch of other cleanup

Here are two gotcha's in trying to get things running:
  1. Make sure you set the PEGASUS_HOME command line variable.
     The repository gets written to $PEGASUS_HOME/repository.
     You can override this with the -R flag on the command line.

  2. If your mof file has include pragmas and the included files
     do not reside in the current directory, you must provide a path
     to them on the compiler command line.  You do this with the 
     -I flag.  Example:

         cimmof -I~/testfiles ~/testfiles/main.mof

     The compiler does not handle missing include files very sanely
     right now.  It just skips them.
