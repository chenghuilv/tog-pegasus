[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mCLI[24m is a test tool for executing CIM client operations from the command
       line. It implements all of the CIM operations except for the modify and
       create operations and includes several other operations that are useful
       in testing including getting all namespaces, enumerating all  instances
       in a namespace.

       each execution of CLI involves a

       [command]  defines  the  CIM  operation  (ex. getclass) or the compound
       operation (enumeratenamespace)

       [object]  This  is  the name of the object input with the command.  For
       example, with the get class
                   operation the object is a class name.  With the getinstance
                   command the object is an objectname. Note that some of  the
                   commands  do not require an object.   Thus, for example the
                   [object] is optional with the  enumerateClassnames  command
                   as it is with the equivalent CIM operation.

       [option...] Options  are  defined with the - or -- notation.  There are
                   two types of options 1. A set of options that are universal
                   and  modify  or  define the execution of the command or the
                   the form of the return.  This includes options like setting
                   the  output  format for object responses or requesting only
                   summary operation.  2. A set of options that represent  the
                   optional  input  parameters for selected commands and a set
                   of options on the command line. The command defines the CIM
                   Operation  that will be executed and the options define the
                   optional



[1mCOMMANDS[0m
       ni     enumerateinstancenames
                 Execute the enumerateInstanceNames CIM Operation.  This oper-
                 ation  takes  as  input  options  TBD  and  returns a list of
                 instanceNames.



       niall enumerateallinstanceNames
                 Execute a CLI function that gets  all  instance  names
                 within  the defined namespace.  This function searches
                 the complete namespace using the CIM  getClass  opera-
                 tion to get the classes and the enumerateInstanceNames
                 command to enumerate all of  the  instances  for  each
                 class. It returns the list of instances found.

       ei    EnumerateInstances
                 Execute  the  CIM  operation enumerateInstances.  This
                 function  takes  as  input  options  specific  to  the
                 command  the  deep inheritance (-di), TBD options.  It
                 returns the instances  found  either  as  MOF  or  XML
                 depending on the output options.

       [1mOPTIONS[0m
              There  are  a significant number of options to this util-
              ity, some if which provide specific information  for  one
              or  more  commands and some of which are universal across
              all of the commands.

       -u   User. Allows input of a user name for authentication

       -p   password. Allows input of a password for server authentica-
            tion of the command

       -l   location. Allows input of the host name for the CIM server.
            This includes the host name and optionally  the  port.  The
            default  is  localhost:5988.   If the port component is not
            input port 5988 is assumed.

       -n   Namespace. Defines the namespace for the operation.

       -di  deepInheritance. Specifies  the  deepInheritance  parameter
            for selected commands if the option is set.  Note that this
            means different things to different commands  and  is  used
            only with the enumerate commands.

       -lo  localOnly.  Specifies the localOnly operation parameter for
            selected commands if the option is set.  See  the  commands
            for more information.

       -iq  includeQualifiers.  Specifies  the includeQualifiers opera-
            tion input paramter for selected commands. if the option is
            set.

       -is  includeClassOrigin
