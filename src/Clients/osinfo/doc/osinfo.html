<h3>
osinfo
</h3>

<h4>
Name
</h4>

<p>
<b>osinfo</b> - gather information regarding the running operating system

<h4>
Synopsis
</h4>

<p>
<code><b>osinfo</b> [ -c ] </code>
</p>


<h4>
Description
</h4>

<p>
The osinfo command displays information regarding the operating system,
gathered via WBEM using the PG_OperatingSystem class supported by the
OperatingSystem Provider (bundled with HP WBEM Services).
</p>

<p>
By default, the information is formatted for display, converting
CIMDateTime strings into a more user-readable format (see Examples),
and converting the total number of seconds of uptime into the 
appropriate number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
</P>

<p>
The <code><b>-c</b></code> option allows the user to specify 
that the information is to be left in the CIM format, and not converted 
from CIMDateTime strings and SystemUpTime seconds.
As specified by the DMTF, the CIMDateTime format is 
yyyymmddhhmmss.mmmmmmsutc, where yyyy is
a 4-digit year, mm is the month, dd is the day, hh is the hour on a 24-hour
clock, mm is the minute, ss is the second, mmmmmm is the number of
microseconds, s is a "+" or "-" indicating the sign of the UTC
(Universal Time Code) correction field (since the DateTime is returned in
the local time zone of the system), and utc is the offset from UTC in
minutes.
</p>

<p>
If a property value is unavailable, it will be shown as "Unknown"
</P>

<h5>
Options
</h5>

<p>
<b><code>osinfo</code></b> recognizes the following options:
<dl>
  <dt>
    <code>-c </code>
  <dd>
    Use the CIM formats for DateTime and SystemUpTime values (not
    the formatting done by default).
</dl>
</p>

<h4>
Dependencies
</h4>

<p>
<b><code>osinfo</code></b> requires HP WBEM Services to be 
installed and running.
</p>

<h5>
Return Value
</h5>

<p>
When an error occurs, an error message is written to stderr and an
appropriate value is returned.  The following values are returned:

<table>
<tr>
<td> 0 </td>
<td> Success </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 1 </td>
<td> Error </td>
</tr>
</table>

The most common error is executing the osinfo command when the CIMOM is
not running (resulting in an "<code>
os info error: Cannot connect" </code> error).  
</p>


<h4>
Examples
</h4>

<p>
Run the default osinfo command.

The system rushmore.cup.hp.com is running version B.11.00 of HP-UX,
has an unlimited user license, and is 32-bit capable.  The Operating
System was last booted on Sept 24, 2001 and the local date and time
are given.  All time values are offset from GMT by -7 hours.
<p> 
Run osinfo, with the values displayed in their CIM format

<p>
The same rushmore.cup.hp.com system is displayed, but in this output the
LastBootTime and LocalDateTime values are in the CIM format.  The SystemUpTime
value is in total seconds (as specified by CIM).  Other fields do not change,
as their CIM specification is the strings themselves.
