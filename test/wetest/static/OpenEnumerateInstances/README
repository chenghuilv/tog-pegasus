This list of static tests only tests error responses and largely those
that might result from parameter errors.  We do not test good
responses in general because That would mean generating multple
requests (i.e. Pull, etc.) which is significantly more complex in this
static environment.  That is more easily accomplished with the dynamic
tools. Further since the new operations return host information in the
path, fixed good responses do not really work.
