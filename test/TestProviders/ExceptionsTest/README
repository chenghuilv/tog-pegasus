ExceptionsTestModule 
--------------------

This test module has the following source programs:

ExceptionsTest.cpp
- This source file implements the provider which supports multiple classes,
ExceptionsTestModule. The parent class in this provider is ExceptionsTestClass.
The classes which are implemented in this provider are, FirstClass, SecondClass
and ThirdClass.

ExceptionsTest.h  - Header for ExceptionsTestClass
ExceptionsTestMain.cpp - This defines the PegasusCreateProvider();
ExceptionsTest.mof - Test Provider Schema registration mof.
ExceptionsTestR.mof - Test Provider Registration mof.

Scripts
-------
testclient: Runs the TestClient program for SampleProvider namespace.

clitests: Runs the CLI client test program with basic CIM Operations (like 
	  enumerate instances, enumerate instance names, enumerate classes etc.)

delete_provider_module: Script which checks if the ExceptionsTestModule is
			registered by the CIMOM and removes it if its present.
	
restartcim - Simply stops and starts the cimserver

The scripts delete_provider_module and restartcim can be used when the complete
ExceptionsTestModule is built and installed again.

Building and Installing
-----------------------
Run the following commands to build and install ExceptionsTestModule:
1. make 
2. make repository
3. make regprovider

Testing
-------
Either run the "clitests" script for individual testing of CIM Operations
OR
Run "testclient" for simultaneous testing of CIM Operations through TestClient.
