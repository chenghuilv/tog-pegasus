Temporary Lifecycle embedded object encoder and decoder.

This branch represents the code for a set of functions to manually
encode and decode lifecycle indications in accord with PEP 172.

It is maintained as a private branch in the Pegasus CVS tree.

It can be merged into other CVS checkouts using the -j option
of CVS to merge the files.  

Generally care has been taken so that it can be merged into 2.3.x
or 2.4.   We do not intend to permanently support these functions and
they will be replaced with a permanent solution probably in Pegasus 2.5
