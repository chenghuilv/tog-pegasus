    1. VxWorks has no fork/exec semantics.

    2. VxWorks has no user database methods.

    3. VxWorks has no file ownership concept.

    4. VxWorks has no popen(), but only needed in Pegasus tests.

    5. VxWorks floating points support is broken.
    
        - printf() prints them as 0.0000, whatever their value.
        - comparisons sometimes fail.

    6. The vxworks target starts up its date set to Jan 1, 1970.

    7. VxWorks does not imlement access. Instead, FileSystem::canRead()
       and FileSystem::canWrite() were reworked to use open()  with O_WRONLY
       or O_RDONLY flags.

    8. Unsupported components:

            - PAM Authentication
            - SSL peer authentication
            - Local authentication
            - SLP
            - IPV6
            - CMPI

    9. gettimeofday() implementation (see Platform_VXWORKS_PENTIUM_GNU.h)
       does not have timezone.

    10. VxWorks fails on host file system after roughly 1000 iterations
        of opendir/readir/closedir.

    11. Restrictions:

            - Repository is read-only (located in /romfs) and must be
              built and configured prior to VxWorks image creation.

    12. Should VxWorks use the configuration file mechanism.

    13. ftruncate() fails when against host file system.

    14. libnet.a was missing for XSCALE/gnu. Needed to do this to build it:

        $ cd /home/WindRiver/vxworks-6.2/target/usr/src/wrn/coreip
        $ make CPU=XSCALE TOOL=gnu

    15. Generated reposity increases from 206K to 1.4MB when the
        "description" qualifiers are included.
