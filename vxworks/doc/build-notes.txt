VXWorks is built with these environment variables:

    PEGASUS_PLATFORM=VXWORKS_PENTIUM_GNU
    PEGASUS_ROOT=<source-distribution-root>
    PEGASUS_HOME=<build-directory-path>
    PEGASUS_DISABLE_PROV_USERCTXT=1
    PEGASUS_DEFAULT_ENABLE_OOP=false

Individual program and libraries can be moved to $PEGASUS_HOME/romfs
by just typing "make romfs". Programs are moved to $PEGASUS_HOME/romfs/bin
and libraries are moved to $PEGASUS_HOME/romfs/lib.

A VXWorks simulator image (that includes the romfs above) can be built by
typing "make" in this directory.
