// This module is a typical implementation of server main for an embedded
// environment. This work is based on the definitions in PEP 305 and the 
// EmbeddedSystemBuild readme. This example creates an embedded cim server and 
// adds the static provider definitions and memory-resident repository 
// definitions. It is expected that an embedded system creator could use this 
// example to create a cim server main specifically for their needs and define 
// their providers and repository in that main.  There is no need that the code
// exist in the Pegasus CVS source tree. This example is in the source tree
// to make it available as a working example. This example was created 
// specifically for VxWorks and the kernel mode.

// main function for the cimserver. Note that in this sample code the
// main function is named cimserver because this example is based on
// use of VxWorks and of the kernel mode rather than the real-time-process 
// mode so that the symbol cimserver becomse the explicit start point for the 
// cimserver.  If this were a VxWorks RTP, this would be main(...)
