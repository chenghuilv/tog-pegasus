February 4, 2001 - Mike Brasher - Remarks about documentation


    1.	There are lots of places where I have blocks like this in headers.

	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	//
	// Array.h
	//
	//	Blah blah blah!
	//
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

	I am starting to remove these.

    2.	Noticed that wer are using templates in a coupld of places. Does DOC++ 
        handle these alright? Array.h

    3.	Is there anyway to cause DOC++ to ignore some classes (like Rep
	classes)?

    4.  Reformatted some comments in Array.h to get this style:

	
	    /** This method does something
		useful.
	    */
	    void f();

	    /** This last method has a newline after it
	        so that lexdisic individuals can see it.
	    */
	    void g();

    5.	Wondering whether CGIQueryString should be moved out of
	<Pegasus/Common> since it is not really part of the core and
	is only used by CGIClient. Perhaps it should reside in CGIClient.

    6.	Should brief comments be terminated or not with periods?

	    /// This method does something.
	    void h();

    7.	Does DOC++ handle ordinary C-style functions (that are not
	methods of classes?

    
    8.	I need to provide some explanation of how the data objects work.
	When the default constructor is used, the object represents a
	null handle, which if referenced, throws a null pointer exception.
	

    9.	Documented Array.h, CGIQueryString.h and Char16.h. Assumed that
	we would not overlap on these.

    10.	Need to talk about ClassDecl.h. Some clarification is needed about
	the way the handles work.
