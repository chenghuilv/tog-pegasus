    (A) Implement instances.

    (A) Providers.

    (A) Port to Windows.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) Finish other CIM/HTTP protocol operations.

    (B) Use the description that comes back with an error code in the XML
    	protocol. Perhaps it should become an extra message field of
	XmlException.

    (B) Source documentation.

    (B) Put README in each directory.

    (B) Handle UCS2 characters in XML (parsing and writing).

    (B) Check for overflow on the number of attributes in XML.

    (B) Handle PARAMETER.REFARRAY in XML.

    (B) Finish Pegasus-CGI interface:

	Add GetMethod.cgi.
	Add propagated and class-origin columns.
	Add flavor column to qualifiers.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (C) Implement Strings that point to preallocated char* that will
        remain in scope?

    (C) Suppress error message printed by ACE caused by constructing an 
        address from a non existent host.

    (C) Ignore extraneous XML elements (loosely valid).

    (C) Get rid of fullyQualified flag.

    (C) Handling of hexadecimal integer values.

    (C) VALUE.REFERENCE within INSTANCENAME and KEYBINDING.

    (C) Resolve whether MOF is a requirement.

    (C) Handle case sensitivity of CIM identifiers.

    (C) Figure out how to handle CIM null values.

    (C) Make iteration scheme more general.

    (C) Develop XML repository importation mechanism.

    (C) Move internal headers to ./internal directory

    (C) Split up XxxRep objects from Xxx objects.

    (C) Handle case insentive requirement on repository file names.

    (C) Devise a way to detect whether a class has instances.

    (C) Cleanup of execeptions.

    (C) Verify that fixed length arrays are properly handled.

    (C) Check for null string pointers in String class.

    (C) Verify that instances are property keyed (during validation).

    (C) Thread safety.

    (C) Use UTF8 for strings.

    (C) Shrink object sizes.

    (C) Use lighter I/O system (get rid of C++ streams).

    (C) Provide conversion between DateTime and time_t.

    (C) Purify source.

    (C) Improve the representation of fixed arrays (is that pesky fixed-array
      	flag really necessary?)
