    1.	Indent four spaces (not three and not tabs).

    2.	Literals used (other than 0 or 1).

    3.	NULL used in several places.

    4.  Put braces on their own lines like this:

	    if (condition)
	    {

	    }

	Avoid this style:

	    if (condition) {

	    }

    5.	Makedepend utility was made the default depend
	utility on some platforms. The deafault should be
	"mu depend".

    6.	Regression tests should only print this:

	    "+++++ passed all tests"

	Extraneous output should be removed.

    7.	All defined constants must begin with "PEGASUS_".

    8.	All method must use the form myMethodName(). Many places
	have my_method_name() (with underscores).

    9.	Avoid use of (void). Use () instead.

    10.	Either get rid of throw() declarations or use them
	everywhere (perhaps they are not supported by some compilers).

    11.	Avoid indenting "private:", "public:" and "protected". Use this
	style:

	    class X
	    {
	    private:
		...
	    public:
	    };

    12.	Use "Type* x" rather than "Type *x".

    13. Use "if (" rather than "if(".

    14.	Avoid use of spaces around the condition:

	    if( cond )

    15.	Keep all lines within 80 columns.

    16.	Build fails on many Linux system (threading support problems).

    17. SSL is the default on Linux (is this okay?).

    19. Fix main logic (Unix v.s. Windows).

    21.	Get rid of CIMIndication class.

    22.	Revise licensing headers on all files.
