---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1 - July 2001 Development branch (Work in Progress)

1. (Nitin Upasani - HP) Implementation of handleIndication() to deliver
   indication by defining IndicationDispatcher, HandlerTable, CIMHandler
   and ExportClient classes. the indication.

   Also implemented CIMxmlIndicationHandler and sendmailIndicationHandler to
   make the delivery of indications over Xml-HTTP and email respectively.

   Provided examples for HandlerTable, XmlIndicationDelivery and
   SendMailIndicationDelivery to support this implementation.

2. (Markus Mueller - IBM) Implementation of a Linux specific threading
   library and a thread-safe message queue (first stage). Classes defined
   are Mutex, Condition, Semaphore, AtomicInt, ReadWriteSem, cleanup_handler
   and SimpleThread.

   to the man page in pegasus/src/Clients/wbemexec/doc/wbemexec.html for more
   information on using wbemexec.  A simple test script is included.  Please
   see pegasus/src/Clients/wbemexec/tests/readme for information on running
   the test script.

4. (Sushma Fernandes - HP)  Implementation of Trace Framework.  Please
   refer to the documentation in src/Pegasus/Common/doc/TracingDevGuide.pdf
   and
   src/Pegasus/Common/doc/TracingUserGuide.pdf for more information on using
   the Trace framework. Classes defined are src/Pegasus/Common/Tracer.cpp and
   src/Pegasus/Common/TraceFileHandler.cpp.

5. (Nag Boranna - HP)  Implementation of Config Framework, Config Provider and

   information on running the test script.

6. (Karl Schopmeyer 31 July 2001) - Add toMof functions to the CIM objects
   (changed the H and CPP files for the major CIM objects. These
   functions generate CIM MOF output for the objects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.99.x (Fixes to version 0.99) in Process

Version 0.97.4 - Tag Created for 0.97.4 and snapshot 7 July 2001

1. Deamonizaiton added to CIMServer.cpp by Mike Day.  This includes code bothe
for NT and Linux platforms.

2. KS Changed the namespace cimv20 to cimv2 and the default port from 888 to
5988.
NOTE: 5988 is now the officially recognized preferred port for a CIMServer by
the DMTF.

3. KS Corrected some errors found in interoperability testing during the DMTF
Fusion event.  THis included a) extended the test for end of HTTP header from
CR/LF/CR/LF to also allow LF/LF.  Not strictly legal but widely used. b).
Extended the HTTP message ID to allow for non-numeric message IDs.

4. Broke out RepositoryDeclContext class from Repository/CIMRepository.cpp
and created RepositoryDeclContext.{cpp,h}.  This is the first step in
revamping the compiler to work independently of the repository (grb).

5. Created new makefile Compiler/Makefile.grammar and modified
Compiler/Makefile; and added cimmof_tab.{cpp,h} and cimmof_lex.cpp.
Now when you build normally, you will get the committed grammar and parser
files instead of generating your own for a particular platform.  This should
prevent back-level lex and yacc implementations from generating troublesome
code.  The committed files are generated from flex 2.5.4 and bison 1,28.
(grb)

6.  Added Compiler/compilerDeclContext.{cpp,h} and makefile changes.
This change paves the way for upcoming changes that will allow the compiler
to work indepently of the repository. (grb)

7. Extend testclient (clients/testclient) tests and functions. ks 19 June 2001

8. CV added const to CIMOperations modifyInstance, createInstance,
modifyClass,
createClass to protect caller's object.

9. CV added CIMQueryProvider and CIMAssociationProvider to the Provider2
directory. These
interfaces allow very smart providers to perform advances operations.
CIMProviderStub has
been updated to support the new interfaces. Needs testing.

10. Added rpm packaging support and shell script based build process. MM

11. Changed Make so make tests no longer rebuilds repository.  To rebuild
repository you make world, make rebuild or make repository. ks

12. Added associators() and associatorNames() operations to CIM repository.
    (MEB)

13. More on association implementation (all four operations supported).
    Need to handle deletion of associations and protocol stubs still.
    Need to test class associations (rather than just instance associations).
    Need to handle deleteInstance().
    (MEB)

14. slp client code integrated as pegasus-style c++ library. (MDD)

15. (Karl)Update CGI Client to correct number of errors and install
AssociationName
and ReferenceName functions.  This included extensive update to the HTML
pages.

16. (Denise E.) Changes to slp client support code for HPUX (

17. (Markus Mueller) Additional changes to support dynamic libraries. Fixed
ProviderTable tests. Fixed build process (slp with PEGASUS_SUPPORTS_DYNLIB).
Made cimserver accept the -D flag to eliminate the need for environment
variables.

18. (Mike Brasher) Added support for Associators(), AssociatorNames(),
    References() and ReferenceNames() CIM operations. These only operate
    on instances at this time. They will operate on classes soon.

19. (Mike Glantz) Extended and modified dynamic support
    changes to (1) work on HP-UX and (2) have all images and libraries
    buildable per the value of PEGASUS_SUPPORTS_DYNLIB. The biggest
    change is to program.mak and library-unix.mak, removing specific
    lists of dynamic library specs and putting them in the Makefile
    and libraries.mak files that build the actual targets (lots of
    these now have DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES defined).

20. (Karl) added basic Queue function to common (based on array) and added
    tests for stack and queue.

Version 0.97.3 - Released 5 June 2001

1. (KS)OptionManager (CPP and H), Logger (CPP and H), Handler (CPP and H),
CIMServer (both)
Functions added include:
	a. Enable trace to log file.
	b. Add option so that you can trace to console or trace to logfile (-l
	is
	   trace to log, -t is trace to console).
	c. add parameter in optionsrow for help message and enable the capture
	   of these messages in Options class.  Also added help print that
	   prints these things out.  However, format not to beautiful.
	d. Eliminate a couple of messages coming from __Namespace provider.
	e. Extend the Clients\testclient so he does tests on Namespace.
2. (KS)Extended Log to show time, severity.

3. (KS)Added getCurrentASCIITime functions to System.x

4. (KS)Extended options on CIMServer including 1. option to determine where
logs
are put

5. (KS)Added TestClient that executes a series of tests against a server.
This is a preliminary version.

6. (KS)Corrected problem with acceptor.bind where failure was being lost. Now
throws CannotBind exception.

7. (KS)Added logger entry to XMLParser for errors.  NOTE: At this point it may
not
print out all of the message.  At the least it prints out the error message
and components of the message causing the problem.

8. (KS)Added clean option to server but temprarily disabled.

9. (KS)Fixed problem where logs were not created unless logs directory already
existed.

10. (Mike Brasher) Added "Test" prefix to all test program names.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.97.2

1. Extend HP UX port to correctly load Dynamic Load Libraries.
2. Extend Formatter for Boolean and Uint32 types.
3. Change CIM Server to use Trace (-t) flag.  This also changed
   Handler.h to work off of flag.
4. Minor corrections to __Namespace Provider.
5. Extend tests for Formatter, String, and other modules.
6. Correct errors in documentation.
7. New working papers (provider interface).
8. Add Providerreg.exe tool.
9. Add trace output for messages sent from the Server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 May 2001 Version 0.97.1 Tags as version_0_971

1. Add PEG_NOT_FOUND symbol to replace Uint32(-1) in any of the object
find functions.  Note: This symbol is defined in config.h. (ks).

2. Port To HP UX.  This required a number of changes particularly in the area
of dynamic lib loaading.

21 May 2001  Version 0.97 - Tagged as version_0_97

1. Added methods in CIMClass, CIMInstance, for existance of properties,
qualifiers, methods.
2. Add methods in CIMClass, CIMInstance to remove properties, qualifier,
methods.
3. Added CIMmethod and CIMProperty in CIMMethod to text for existance of
qualifiers and to
remove qualifiers.
4. Ported to AIX. NOTE: This port was done using an earlier version of the AIX
compiler.  It probably imposed more limitations than would be required with
the current compiler.  This version of the port produces an excessively large
common module due to template bloat.  That problem will be fixed in a future
change to the port. Also there are a log of duplicate symbol warnings generate
by the AIC compiler but these cause no problems.  The port has been tested
with the complete unit test and client/server test successfully.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 May 2001

1.  Ported to HPUX

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

29 May 2001

1.  Implemented CIMRepository::setProperty() and CIMRepository::getProperty().
