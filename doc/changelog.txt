CHANGE LOG FOR PEGASUS



------------------------------------------------------------------------
21 May 2001  Version 0.97

1. Added methods in CIMClass, CIMInstance, for existance of properties,
qualifiers, methods.
2. Add methods in CIMClass, CIMInstance to remove properties, qualifier,
methods.
3. Added CIMmethod and CIMProperty in CIMMethod to text for existance of
qualifiers and to
remove qualifiers.
4. Ported to AIX. NOTE: This port was done using an earlier version of the AIX
compiler.  It probably imposed more limitations than would be required with
the current compiler.  This version of the port produces an excessively large
common module due to template bloat.  That problem will be fixed in a future
change to the port. Also there are a log of duplicate symbol warnings generate
by the AIC compiler but these cause no problems.  The port has been tested
with the complete unit test and client/server test successfully.
