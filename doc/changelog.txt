CHANGE LOG FOR PEGASUS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.97.4 - In Process.

1. Deamonizaiton added to CIMServer.cpp by Mike Day.  This includes code bothe
for NT and Linux platforms.

2. KS Changed the namespace cimv20 to cimv2 and the default port from 888 to
5988.
NOTE: 5988 is now the officially recognized preferred port for a CIMServer by
the DMTF.

3. KS Corrected some errors found in interoperability testing during the DMTF
Fusion event.  THis included a) extended the test for end of HTTP header from
CR/LF/CR/LF to also allow LF/LF.  Not strictly legal but widely used. b).
Extended the HTTP message ID to allow for non-numeric message IDs.

4. Broke out RepositoryDeclContext class from Repository/CIMRepository.cpp
and created RepositoryDeclContext.{cpp,h}.  This is the first step in
revamping the compiler to work independently of the repository (grb).

5. Created new makefile Compiler/Makefile.grammar and modified
Compiler/Makefile; and added cimmof_tab.{cpp,h} and cimmof_lex.cpp.
Now when you build normally, you will get the committed grammar and parser
files instead of generating your own for a particular platform.  This should
prevent back-level lex and yacc implementations from generating troublesome
code.  The committed files are generated from flex 2.5.4 and bison 1,28.
(grb)

6.  Added Compiler/compilerDeclContext.{cpp,h} and makefile changes.
This change paves the way for upcoming changes that will allow the compiler
to work indepently of the repository. (grb)

7. Extend testclient (clients/testclient) tests and functions. ks 19 June 2001

8. CV added const to CIMOperations modifyInstance, createInstance,
modifyClass,
createClass to protect caller's object.

9. CV added CIMQueryProvider and CIMAssociationProvider to the Provider2
directory. These
interfaces allow very smart providers to perform advances operations.
CIMProviderStub has
been updated to support the new interfaces. Needs testing.

10. Added rpm packaging support and shell script based build process. MM

11. Changed Make so make tests no longer rebuilds repository.  To rebuild
repository you make world, make rebuild or make repository. ks

12. Added associators() and associatorNames() operations to CIM repository.
    (MEB)

13. More on association implementation (all four operations supported).
    Need to handle deletion of associations and protocol stubs still.
    Need to test class associations (rather than just instance associations).
    Need to handle deleteInstance().
    (MEB)

14. slp client code integrated as pegasus-style c++ library. (MDD)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.97.3 - Released 5 June 2001

1. (KS)OptionManager (CPP and H), Logger (CPP and H), Handler (CPP and H),
CIMServer (both)
Functions added include:
	a. Enable trace to log file.
	b. Add option so that you can trace to console or trace to logfile (-l
	is
	   trace to log, -t is trace to console).
	c. add parameter in optionsrow for help message and enable the capture
	   of these messages in Options class.  Also added help print that
	   prints these things out.  However, format not to beautiful.
	d. Eliminate a couple of messages coming from __Namespace provider.
	e. Extend the Clients\testclient so he does tests on Namespace.
2. (KS)Extended Log to show time, severity.
3. (KS)Added getCurrentASCIITime functions to System.x
4. (KS)Extended options on CIMServer including 1. option to determine where
logs
are put
5. (KS)Added TestClient that executes a series of tests against a server.
This is a preliminary version.
6. (KS)Corrected problem with acceptor.bind where failure was being lost. Now
throws CannotBind exception.
7. (KS)Added logger entry to XMLParser for errors.  NOTE: At this point it may
not
print out all of the message.  At the least it prints out the error message
and components of the message causing the problem.
8. (KS)Added clean option to server but temprarily disabled.
9. (KS)Fixed problem where logs were not created unless logs directory already
existed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.97.2

1. Extend HP UX port to correctly load Dynamic Load Libraries.
2. Extend Formatter for Boolean and Uint32 types.
3. Change CIM Server to use Trace (-t) flag.  This also changed
   Handler.h to work off of flag.
4. Minor corrections to __Namespace Provider.
5. Extend tests for Formatter, String, and other modules.
6. Correct errors in documentation.
7. New working papers (provider interface).
8. Add Providerreg.exe tool.
9. Add trace output for messages sent from the Server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 May 2001 Version 0.97.1 Tags as version_0_971

1. Add PEG_NOT_FOUND symbol to replace Uint32(-1) in any of the object
find functions.  Note: This symbol is defined in config.h. (ks).

2. Port To HP UX.  This required a number of changes particularly in the area
of dynamic lib loaading.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21 May 2001  Version 0.97 - Tagged as version_0_97

1. Added methods in CIMClass, CIMInstance, for existance of properties,
qualifiers, methods.
2. Add methods in CIMClass, CIMInstance to remove properties, qualifier,
methods.
3. Added CIMmethod and CIMProperty in CIMMethod to text for existance of
qualifiers and to
remove qualifiers.
4. Ported to AIX. NOTE: This port was done using an earlier version of the AIX
compiler.  It probably imposed more limitations than would be required with
the current compiler.  This version of the port produces an excessively large
common module due to template bloat.  That problem will be fixed in a future
change to the port. Also there are a log of duplicate symbol warnings generate
by the AIC compiler but these cause no problems.  The port has been tested
with the complete unit test and client/server test successfully.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 May 2001

1.  Ported to HPUX

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

29 May 2001

1.  Implemented CIMRepository::setProperty() and CIMRepository::getProperty().
