CHANGE LOG FOR PEGASUS


Version 1.07 working towards 1.1 - Started 4 Feb 2002
Started just before cutover to the new dispatcher, etc.
TAG: VERSION_1_07

1. KS - Updated pegsusversion to 1.07  and tagged file.

2. (Markus Mueller) 05 Feb 2002 - AIX support.

3. (Sushma Fernandes - HP) 13 Feb 2002 Implemented FileSystemPropertyOwner
    class to support PEGASUS_HOME dependent properties like Repository
    location, Provider location and Consumer location.
    The default location for these properties continue to be the same
    as before. Added support to the Config Manager to own the
    Pegasus Home variable and implemented method (getHomedPath) to
    return absolute paths based from Pegasus Home.

    For more information look in to the following files:
    pegasus/src/Pegasus/Config/ConfigManager.h
    pegasus/src/Pegasus/Config/ConfigManager.cpp
    pegasus/src/Pegasus/Config/FileSystemPropertyOwner.h
    pegasus/src/Pegasus/Config/FileSystemPropertyOwner.cpp

4. KS -  18 Feb 02 Add changes to test for and set the NULL value for CIMValues.
   This forces new CIMValues to have a NULL attributes that is only
   reset when a value is "set" or copied into them.  the XML and MOF
   also deliver a NULL value back when the state of the CIMValue is NULL.
   There is a remaining addition to put an exception on CIMValue gets when
   the NULL attribute is set that we will install later.
   
5. KS - 19 Feb 2002 Extended testclient slightly and cleaned up numerous bugs.

6. KS - 19 Feb 2002 - Add workpaper in doc/workpaper defining the Pegasus Qualifiers.
   Note that this version of the paper still needs work.

7. (Nag Boranna - HP) 20 Feb 2002 - Modified HTTPAcceptor to optionally bind to 
loopback host. Modified CIMClient to connect to loopback host when connectLocal() 
method is used. Added a new method lookupPort() in System.h to return the system 
configured wbem port number. Modified cimuser, cimauth and cimconfig CLI's to use 
modified CIMClient connectLocal() interface.

8. (KS- 21 Feb 2002) - Modified Makefile for repository load so located in
schema directory.  The one in src/pegasus/compiler/load is deprecated and
will be deleted.

9. KS-21 Feb 2002 - Added new constructor to CIMValue and associated tests

10. RK-20 Feb 2002 - Add Array reference to CIMValue and added tests

11. (Sushma Fernandes - HP, Nag Boranna - HP) 22 Feb 2002 Implemented
    checks for privileged user when performing authorization.
    Added a configuration property enableRemotePrivilegedUserAccess.
    This property needs to be set to true to enable privileged user access
    for remote clients.

12. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 22 Feb 2002 - Added type information to extrinsic
    method (InvokeMethod) operations.  This change involves the addition
    of PARAMTYPE attributes to PARAMVALUE and RETURNVALUE tags.  This tag
    allows the server to determine the type of a parameter value without
    having to look up the method definition in the schema.  It also allows
    the client API to do the same for output parameters as well as return
    values.

    PROVIDER IMPLICATIONS:

    Method providers ARE affected by this change.  Previously, all input
    parameters to invokeMethod were sent to the provider as String type
    regardless of what the client actually specified or how the method
    was defined.  With this change, providers will now receive input
    parameters of the type that was actually specified by the client
    application (regardless of how the method was defined in the schema).

    However, parameters coming from clients other than the Pegasus client
    API may omit the PARAMTYPE attribute.  In this case, the operation
    processor (currently dispatcher) will find these "typeless" parameters
    and convert them to the correct type based on the method definition.
    The result is that if the client specifies the parameter type in the
    XML encoding (as the Pegasus client API does), the method provider
    will receive the type specified by the client; if the client does not
    specify the parameter type, the method provider will see the type
    specified in the method definition.

    CLIENT IMPLICATIONS:

    Clients ARE affected by this change.  Any output parameters that are
    returned from Pegasus (or other CIM servers using the PARAMTYPE
    attribute) will now be received by Pegasus clients as the same type
    sent by the server.  Previously, they would have always been of
    String type.  In addition, the return value will be received as the
    correct type rather than as a String.

    Parameters coming from servers other than Pegasus may omit the
    PARAMTYPE attribute.  In this case, the client will see a
    CIMParamValue with type==CIMType::NONE, with a CIMValue of type
    String.  Similarly, return values coming from other servers that omit
    PARAMTYPE will be seen by the client as String type.  These return
    values will NOT have the CIMType::NONE hint that parameters get,
    because they are CIMValues rather than CIMParamValues.

    This behavior will remain for the forseeable future (through
    Pegasus version 2), as it is not possible to require that other
    implementations use the PARAMTYPE attribute.

    SIDE EFFECTS:

    In the process of implementing this functionality, I discovered
    that there was no way to set a CIMValue to be an array of
    CIMReferences.  This appeared to be an oversight, since method
    parameters are permitted to be arrays of CIMReferences.  I've
    added the necessary functionality to the CIMValue class.

    I also found that the CIMParamValue class needed significant
    clean-up, which I completed.

    SETPROPERTY CHANGES:

    A similar problem in SetProperty operations was addressed by
    "typing" the specified property value in the operation processor
    (currently dispatcher).  This is achieved by looking up the
    relevant schema to get the property definition, and then converting
    the specified value to that property's type.

    The SetProperty operation encoding has not changed to accomodate
    inclusion of type information that would obviate the need for this
    extra processing.  However, clients can avoid this overhead by using
    ModifyInstance operations (with a property list) instead of SetProperty.

    The GetProperty operation also has NOT been updated with type
    information.  Client applications using the Pegasus client API will
    always receive String or reference values when calling GetProperty
    against any server (Pegasus or not).  Clients that require properties
    to be returned as the correct type must use GetInstance (perhaps with
    a property list) rather than GetProperty.

13. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 22 Feb 2002 - Reworked the CIMParamValue class.
    Instead of being composed of a CIMParameter and a CIMValue, this
    class is now composed of a String (parameter name) and a CIMValue.
    This change removes the redundancy of having the type, isArray,
    and arraySize members in both the CIMParameter and the CIMValue.
    The new CIMParamValue definition is more consistent with the XML
    encoding of parameter values.

    An isTyped member was also added to CIMParamValue to support the
    behavior outlined in item 12 above.  Clients should use the isTyped()
    method to determine whether the output parameters returned from
    InvokeMethod operations are of the correct type, or whether they
    have defaulted to String type.
    
14. (KS) 4 March 2002 - Corrections for NULL value and the XML code.
    Corrections to compiler for Null values input (parser and valuectory)
  
15. (Nag Boranna - HP) 04 March 2002 - Modified CIMClient API to accept 
    username and password as parameters to connect() method, added a new 
    method diconnect() that closes the open connection with the server 
    and added code to handle HTTP Basic authentication challenges from 
    the server.
    
16  (KS) 4 March 2002 - Correct problem with array constants not picking up
    all of the entires in the array. Bugzilla bug # 6.
   

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.06 working towards 1.1 Started 13 December 2001

1. Merged back to Main branch.  All general development will be in main branch 
       in the future with releases in side branches. Special side developments
       may temporarily be in side branches.
       Changed cimversion to 1.06.  We will do 1.1 based on functionality.
       
2. (Karl) 18 December 2001 - Added new directory repositories where repository 
	implementations will be kept to separate them from the 
	repository interface defintion. Initial implementation is genericfile
	which is the current file based repository.
	
	Added new build variable RMREPOSITORY which is a generic MAKE command
	to remove an existing repository.  It simply substitutes for the RMDIRHIER
	command at this point but we will make this a generic part of system
	in the future.

3. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 18 Dec 2001 - Updated the CIMOperationRequestDecoder
   to check that all required parameters for intrinsic methods are
   present.  If a required parameter is missing, a CIM_ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER
   exception is thrown.  Also added checks for duplicate parameters in the
   intrinsic methods.  If a parameter is specified more than once, a
   CIM_ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER exception is thrown.

4. (Nag Boranna - HP) 14 Jan 2002 - Created CIMOperationRequestAuthorizer queue
   and moved Authorization verification code from CIMOperationRequestDecoder
   queue to this new queue. Modified CIMServer.cpp to create
   CIMOperationRequestAuthorizer queue only when authorization is enabled.
   Also modified CIMRequestMessagesin CIMMessage.h to include userName to make
   it available to the CIMOperationRequestDispatcher.

5. (Mary Hinton - Jan 17, 2002) Fixed the problem with the CIMserver when it 
   runs as a Windows service. The work thread was exiting instead of running 
   forever. The problem was noticed when the TestClient program and CIMserver 
   service were both running. The service wasn't accessible to the TestClient 
   program.

6. (Nitin Upasani - Jan 25, 2002) Operations on CIM_IndicationSubscription, 
    CIM_IndicationHandlerCIMXML and CIM_IndicationFilter classes will be now processed
    in new queue, IndicationService which will get invoked from dispatcher.
    CIM_CREATE_INSTANCE_REQUEST_MESSAGE
    CIM_MODIFY_INSTANCE_REQUEST_MESSAGE
    CIM_DELETE_INSTANCE_REQUEST_MESSAGE
    CIM_GET_INSTANCE_REQUEST_MESSAGE
    CIM_ENUMERATE_INSTANCES_REQUEST_MESSAGE
    CIM_ENUMERATE_INSTANCE_NAMES_REQUEST_MESSAGE

    This new service will also take care of processing the indications on receiving
    CIM_PROCESS_INDICATION_REQUEST_MESSAGE. This message should come from 
    IndicationProvider or some other mechanism which is not yet clear. 

    IndicationService will also receive following messages from PG_ProviderRegistration
    when a new IndicationProvider will get registered.
    CIM_NOTIFY_PROVIDER_REGISTRATION_REQUEST_MESSAGE
    CIM_NOTIFY_PROVIDER_TERMINATION_REQUEST_MESSAGE

    I had also defined new Indication Provider APIs, enableIndication, disableIndication
    and modifyIndication with more parameters passed and eventually planning to terminate
    old APIs (provideIndication, cancelIndication and updateIndication). Also there is a 
    plan to implement one more call as startIndication and will be done soon.

    There are three new test programs in IndicationService directory, which will create 
    Filter, Indication and Subscription instances using IndicationService.

    Also modified sample IndicationProvider code with the new APIs introduced.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1.1 - 3 August 2001 -  Development Branch (Work in Progress)
		current working dev branch of build

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1 - July 2001 Development branch (Work in PRogress)

1. (Mike Brasher) Fixed bug with XML generation (was not generating
   PARAMETER.REFERENCE constructs for references).

2. (Mike Brasher) Reworked server communication into new module scheme.
=======
1. (Karl) 6 Aug - extend ToMof functions. The MOF for a class can now be
	seen as part of CGIclient class displays.
	
2. (Karl) 7 Aug - Update CIM25 Schema from the "preliminary" version
	to the final version in Schemas\CIM25.  This included minor
	corrections, etc and a couple of file changes. This is the
	official final CIM 25 schema relesed by the DMTF.  This change
	should not affect any current work.
3. (Karl) 7 Aug 2001 - Added CIM Schema 2.6 (preliminary) to the Schemas
	directorys.  Note however that today the make repository still
	loads the 2.5 schema.
	
4. (Karl) 8 Aug 2001 - Change cimmofparser.cpp to put header and trailers
        on XML output.
        
5. (Denise Eckstein - HP) 13 Aug 2001 - Fixed an HP-UX compile problem
in various src/utils/mu commands (MoveCmd.cpp, PrependCmd.cpp, RmCmd.cpp,
RmDirHierCmd.cpp, StripCmd.cpp, TouchCmd.cpp).  aCC scopes variable
declarations in for loop initializers outside the loop, so multiple
"for (int i=0; i<10; i++);" statements cause a compile error.

6. (Nag Boranna - HP) 15 Aug 2001 - Modified Config framework to remove 
dependency on the config files at the start of the cimserver. Now the 
cimserver will use in-memory default values in the absence of config files 
and command line options. Fixed a few defects in the config framework that 
were causing cimom to crash under certain conditions. Changed the config 
provider class name to 'PG_ConfigSetting' in the mof file and modified 
provider implementation files accordingly. Also modified the config CLI 
to show user friendly error/status messages.
        
7. (Carol Ann Krug Graves - HP) 16 Aug 2001 - Fixed a bug in wbemexec CLI 
(reported incorrect line number on error in XML request if input redirected).  
Enhanced the -d debug command line option to allow more flexibility in 
generating debug output.

8. Karl 17 Aug 2001) - Extended CIMMOF compiler to put pegasus comment line in
xml when it generates xml output.

9. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 20 Aug 2001 - Combine instances of each class into
a common file to reduce the number of files required by the default
repository implementation.

10. (Mike Brasher) - Fixed minor bug in repository implementation.

11. (Mike Brasher) - Committed fix to missing PARAMETER.REFERENCE XML element.

12. (Mike Brasher) - Committed rework of server into queue approach.

13. (Mike Brasher) - New webserver and webclient examples.

14. (Sushma Fernandes - HP) 21 Aug 2001 - Fixed a bug that was creating an empty file when trace was not enabled. Changed the Tracer test program's executable file name to TracerTest instead of Tracer.

15. (Mike Brasher) - Initial work on refactorying client into modules.
    CIMOperationRequestEncoder and partial CIMOperationResponseDecoder.

16. (Mike Brasher) - queue-based clients now complete.

17. (Jim Chou - HP) 12 Sep 2001 - Initial contribution of wbemexec test directory and make infrastructure.  This submittal also includes an initial set of test scripts.

18. (Markus Mueller - IBM) 13 Sep 2001 - Initial support for z/OS on z/Series, the successor of OS/390 and MVS.

19. (Warren Otsuka - HP) 14 Sep 2001 - Implementation of servlet web server
    interface to CIMServer.This is for the PEGASUS CIM Server to coexist with
    a web server. See doc/Servlet for more information.

20. (Yi Zhou - HP) 20 Sep 2001 - Added tracing in files
    CIMOperationRequestDecoder.cpp and CIMOperationResponseEncoder.cpp so XML 
    input and output can be written in a trace file.

21. (Markus Mueller - IBM) 25 Sep 2001 - Initial Signal Handler support
    Created new class SignalHandler that allow registration, activation and
    deactivation of signal handler functions (Linux only !).

22. (Nitin Upasani - HP) 27 Sep 2001 - Modification of ExportServer and
    ExportClient to support ExportIndication. DisplayConsumer, a sample
    consumer is added which will consume (by displaying on screen) the
    indication exported by CIMExportRequestDispatcher. This complete
    implementation is based on CIM_EXPORT_INDICATION_REQUEST and
    RESPONSE messages. CIMMessage.h, Message.cpp and Message.h files
    are modified to implement above messages. 

    XmlIndicationDispatcher test program is modified to test complete
    operation. It now creates a consumer, handler and indication
    instance and then calls CIMExportRequestDispatcher to export the
    indication to consumer. This program needs
    src/Pegasus/Server/tests/XmlIndicationDispatcher/TestSoftwarePkg.mof 
    and Schemas/Pegasus/PG_ConsumerRegistration.mof files to be loaded
    in the repository to complete the test successfully. This test
    program also needs Handler qualifier defined in repository and
    modify CIM_Event25.mof for CIM_IndicationHandlerXMLHTTP class as
    below:

    //====================================================================
    //  CIM_IndicationHandlerXMLHTTP
    //====================================================================
    [Description (
      "CIM_IndicationHandlerXMLHTTP describes the destination for "
      "Indications to be delivered via HTTP, using a cimXML "
      "representation."), Handler ("CIMxmlIndicationHandler") ]

23. (Sushma Fernandes - HP) 27 Sep 2001 - Added tracing code in
    ProviderTable.cpp and SystemUnix.cpp to indicate progress of loading
    a provider library.

24. (Nitin Upasani - HP) 05 Oct 2001 - implementation of InvokeMethod
    interface for the provider. InvokeMethod currently uses CIMValue as
    type for inParameters and outParameters, which are unable to give
    information about param name, type and value. This should be changed
    to CIMParamValue which will help providers to know details of the
    parameter name and type along with value passed through InvoleMethod
    call. Current implementation uses CIMParamValue as parameters while
    travelling through message queues and converts it back to array of
    CIMValue before calling Provider API (which needs to be changed
    later). 

    Also added are two test programs: 
	
    src/Pegasus/Common/tests/ParamValue - which demonstrate use of
        CIMParamValue class.
	
    src/Pegasus/Client/tests/InvokeMethod - which makes call to
        InvokeMethod and displays the return value. Current
        implementation assumes that provider had returned true value
        and outParameters (which are now hard coded in
        CIMOperationRequestDispatcher to implement functionality)
        which are passed as response of InvokeMethod to client.

25. (Nag Boranna - HP) 05 Oct 2001 - Added first level implementation of
    authentication to the pegasus code. Created an Authentication Manager
    and authenticator interfaces. The file based local authentication
    module has been modified to implement the local authenticator
    interface, to generate the challenge for the unauthorized requests
    and to verify the authentication.

    A skeleton program has been created for the Basic Authenticator.
    This code is in the Security/Authentication directory which is not
    yet linked into the build.

26. (Nitin Upasani - HP) 08 Oct 2001 - Changes to Operation and Export
    Decoders. Earlier decoders were sending requests and responses
    before finishing complete Xml parse. This was prone to send
    request/response even the Xml is wrong after the MethodCall.
    New changes collects the Message* as return value from the
    appropriate functions while parsing the Xml and sends on
    _outputQueue only when Xml is parsed successfully.

27. (Nag Boranna - HP) 11 Oct 2001 - Modified ProviderModule.cpp to
    fix the problem with constructing provider name and loading the
    providers for unix platforms. Also moved the shared library name
    construction (appending .sl or .so) from
    CIMOperationRequestDispatcher.cpp/SystemUnix.cpp to
    ProviderModule.cpp and included it in a method that returns
    provider file path name.

28. (Nitin Upasani - HP) 12 Oct 2001 - Implementation of SNMP Indication
    Handler. This handler extracts MappingStrings qualifier from class
    definition and converts it into SNMP specific trap data. The trap
    structure is defined in a abstract class in snmpDeliverTrap.h file.
    Every one has his or her own SNMP agent, which will talk with master
    agent to deliver the trap or may have some other mechanism.
    Extending snmpDeliverTrap class and deliverTrap method will help to
    implement specific trap delivery mechanism. 

29. (Yi Zhou - HP) 09 Oct 2001 - Changed cimconfig to allow setting property to
    be NULL. Also, if -u -p specified in the cimconfig, instead of updating
    property value to be default in the plan file, remove the property from the
    plan file. Converted ConfigSettingProvider to use provider2 library.

30. (Sushma Fernandes - HP) 24 Oct 2001 - Added an interface to the tracer 
    to allow tracing of a specific number of bytes in a given
    string. Also modified the XmlIO trace code to use the new interface. 
    Changed the config file defaults for tracing.

31. (Rudy Schuet - Compaq) 28 Oct 2001 - Added "make" support for Compaq
    NonStop platform (NSK) in directory pegasus/mak. The following files
    were added:  platform_NSK_NONSTOP_NMCPLUS.mak, objects-nsk.mak,
    library-nsk.mak, config-nsk.mak, program-nsk.mak, program-windows.mak, 
    program-unix.mak. The original program.mak which previously covered
    all platforms was split into platform-specific make files, and now
    only contains conditionals. Files config.mak, objects.mak, and
    library.mak were changed to include the NSK files. 
    File platform_NSK_NONSTOP_NMCPLUS.mak includes config-nsk.mak.

32. (Jenny Yu - HP) 29 Oct 2001 - Fixed CIMReference constructor to allow
    commas (,) in the string values of key properties.
    
33. (Karl Schopmeyer) 30 October 2001- Move the repository load to CIM schema 2.6

34. (Rudy Schuet - Compaq) 30 Oct 2001 - Fixed a problem in
    pegasus/mak/program-windows.mak that prevented program builds for
    the windows platform (related to change from 28 Oct). Replaced
    leading whitespace in front of commands with tabs as required
    in make files.
   
35. (K Schopmeyer) 2 Nov 2001 - Temporarily moved repository back to CIM25 
    because getting an error in 26

35. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 30 Oct 2001 - Association classes have keys
    whose types are references.  These reference values must be
    treated specially in the XML encoding, using the VALUE.REFERENCE
    tag structure.

    Pegasus had been passing reference values simply as String values.
    For example, EnumerateInstanceNames returned KEYVALUEs of string
    type rather than VALUE.REFERENCEs.

    I've modified the XmlReader::getKeyBindingElement() and
    CIMReference::instanceNameToXml() methods to read and write the
    XML in the proper format.  However, making that change required
    that a CIMReference object be able to distinguish between a key
    of String type and a key of reference type.

    I've modified the String format of CIMReferences slightly to
    allow efficient processing of references whose keys are also of
    reference type.  The "official" form uses the same encoding for
    key values of String type and of reference type, and so it
    would be necessary to retrieve the class definition and look up
    the types of the key properties to determine how to treat the
    key values.  This is clearly too inefficient for internal
    transformations between CIMReferences and String values.

    The workaround is to encode a 'R' at the beginning of the value
    for a key of reference type (before the opening '"').  This allows
    the parser to know a priori whether the key is of String or
    reference type.

    In this example:

        MyClass.Key1="StringValue",Key2=R"RefClass.KeyA="StringA",KeyB=10"

    Property Key1 of class MyClass is of String type, and so it gets
    the usual encoding.  Key2 is a reference property, so the extra 'R'
    is inserted before its encoded value.  Note that this algorithm is
    recursive, such that RefClass could include KeyC of reference type,
    which would also get encoded with the 'R' notation.

    The toString() method inserts the 'R' to provide symmetry.  A new
    KeyBinding type (REFERENCE) has been defined to denote keys in a
    CIMReference that are of reference type.  This KeyBinding type must
    be used appropriately for CIMReference::ttoString() to behave
    correctly.

    The files that have been modified to make this change are
    CIMReference.h, CIMReference.cpp, and CIMInstanceRep.cpp.

    A result of this change is that instances names in the instance
    repository will include this extra 'R' character.  Thus, you will
    need to repopulate your repository when you download the latest
    CIMOM version.

    Note that for user-facing uses of the String encoding of instance
    names (such as might appear in MOF for static association
    instances or in the CGI client), this solution is non-standard and
    therefore unacceptable.  It is likely that these points will need
    to process the more expensive operation of retrieving the class
    definition to determine the key property types.

36. (Sushma Fernandes - HP) Modified tracer to return invalid components 
    in case of error in setting trace components. Modified the property owner
    init and update methods. Submitted the pegasus/mak/Buildmakefile with 
    cleanbuild, rebuild and trace configuration options.

37. (Yi Zhou - HP) 05 Nov 2001 - Fixed createInstance to return a CIMReference 
    (instanceName).

38. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 08 Nov 2001 - Implemented encoding/decoding of
    GetProperty/SetProperty/EnumerateInstances request/response messages.
    Added encoding and decoding of PropertyList parameters on all
    relevant intrinsic methods.

39. (Markus Mueller - IBM) 09 Nov 2001 - Added Associator calls to CIMBase
    ProviderFacade.cpp; fixed Provider unloading in CIMProviderManager.cpp

40. (Rudy Schuet - Compaq) 12 Nov 2001 - Common module: added the following
    files for nsk platform support: TraceFileHandlerNsk.cpp, ThreadNsk.cpp,
    TCPChannelNsk.cpp, SystemNsk.cpp, ServiceNsk.cpp, SelectorNsk.cpp,
    IPCNsk.cpp, DirNsk.cpp. Most of these files (with the exception of
    SystemNsk.cpp) contain stubs. The associated control files
    (TraceFileHandler.cpp, Thread.cpp, etc) have been updated to include
    nsk platform links. 

41. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 14 Nov 2001 - Changed the behavior of the CIMValue
    toString() method for CIMValues of String type.  The old behavior
    returned an XML encoding of the String with special characters
    replaced by their UTF-8 equivalents.  For example, a CIMValue of a"b
    would be returned as a&quot;b.  The new behavior just returns the
    String value directly with no translation.  (Note that
    CIMValue.toXml() may still be used to get the XML-encoded value.)

    This change was necessary in part to correct the behavior of the
    repository.  CreateInstance stores the instance name returned by
    CIMInstance.getInstanceName(), which is built using calls to
    CIMValue.toString().  GetInstance searches for the instance name
    without UTF-8 encoding of special characters.  For GetInstance to
    be successful, CreateInstance must have stored the instance name
    in that same form, without special character encoding.

42. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 15 Nov 2001 - Added a toXml(void) method to
    the CIMValue class.  Eliminated improper use of CIMValue.toString(),
    often replacing with CIMValue.get(String&) or CIMValue.toXml().
    Also added some error handling in the indication handlers.

43. (Sushma Fernandes - HP) 16 Nov 2001 - Added a function 
    localObjectPathtoXml(Array<Sint8>& out) to the CIMReference class 
    to handle local instance path and local classpath. Modified the 
    CIMOperationRequestDecoder to handle <LOCALCLASSPATHELEMENT ...>. 
    Changed the CIMOperationRequestEncoder to call the localObjectPathtoXml.

44. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 19 Nov 2001 - Added a CIMNamedInstance class
    to hold the argument to ModifyInstance and the return values
    from EnumerateInstances.  The client and provider APIs need to
    be updated to use this class.

45. (Sushma Fernandes - HP) 19 Nov 2001 - Added the cimuser command line 
    source files. This CLI allows addition, modification, removal and listing 
    of CIM users. The CLI is not linked to the main makefile as the Provider 
    functionality is yet to be implemented. Added the function 
    String getPassword(char* prompt) to the System.h and cpp files.

46. (Nag Boranna - HP) 20 Nov 2001 - Implemented Authentication code on
    the server to challenge the unauthorized requests, authenticate
    the challenge responses, and verify the subsequent authorized requests.
    Implemented authentication mechanism on the Client api to send
    responses to the challenges from the server. Current implementation
    supports only 'local' authentication mechanism.

47. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 20 Nov 2001 - Commited the following set of changes:

      - Changed the return value of EnumerateInstances from Array<CIMInstance>
          to Array<CIMNamedInstance>
      - Changed the parameter to ModifyInstance from CIMInstance to
          CIMNamedInstance
      - Added an optional PropertyList parameter to ModifyInstance
      - Changed all handling of PropertyList parameters to use the
          CIMPropertyList class instead of Array<String>

    Each of these changes was required to comply with the DMTF specification.

    These changes were made throughout the system except for in the provider
    API.  For now, the CIMProviderHandle and CIMBaseProviderHandle hide the
    differences from providers, so older providers will continue to function.
    However, this means that clients can not yet take advantage of the added
    functionality.

    When the provider API is updated, the following changes will be visible:

      - Providers will get a PropertyList parameter to ModifyInstance which
          they are required to respect.  Providers that can not process the
          PropertyList must throw a NOT_SUPPORTED exception whenever the
          list is not null.  Clients can take advantage of this change by
          issuing a ModifyInstance request against a selected set of
          properties in an instance, rather than being required to replace
          the entire instance.

      - Providers will be required to return instance names along with
          instances in the EnumerateInstances method.  Clients will receive
          these instance names, as the standard dictates.

      - Providers will receive a CIMPropertyList argument containing the
          PropertyList instead of an Array<String>.  This change allows
          providers to distinguish between an empty list and a null list.

    Note that the repository also does not yet handle the PropertyList in
    ModifyInstance correctly.

48. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 21 Nov 2001 - I have updated the Provider2 instance
    provider API to match the changes made to the EnumerateInstances and
    ModifyInstance operations.  These changes were made to comply with
    the DMTF specification.

    The original Provider API has not been updated, and I have no
    plans to do so.  Providers written to the original API will
    continue to function, but they will not have the opportunity
    to take advantage of the features that have been added.

    The significant changes to the Provider2 API are:

      - Providers will get a PropertyList parameter to ModifyInstance which
          they are required to respect.  Providers that can not process the
          PropertyList must throw a NOT_SUPPORTED exception whenever the
          list is not null.  Clients can take advantage of this change by
          issuing a ModifyInstance request against a selected set of
          properties in an instance, rather than being required to replace
          the entire instance.

      - Providers will get an IncludeQualifiers parameter to ModifyInstance
          which they are required to respect.  If IncludeQualifiers is
          false, the qualifiers on the modified instance provided must not
          be used to update the instance.

      - Providers will be required to return instance names along with
          instances in the EnumerateInstances method.  Clients will receive
          these instance names, as the standard dictates.

    The providers that are in the Pegasus build have all been updated.
    However, whenever the PropertyList is not null, the providers throw
    a NOT_SUPPORTED exception.

49. (Rudy Schuet - Compaq) 25 NOV 2001 - To support the NSK platform,
    files Platform_NSK_NONSTOP_NMCPLUS.h and ConfigNsk.h were added to
    the Common module. File Config.h was modified to include the NSK
    platform and a new option PEGASUS_HAVE_NO_STD that allows compilation
    without the standard (std) namespace.

50. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 26 Nov 2001 - Added two new configuration
    properties to support alternate behavior of the Pegasus repository:
    repositoryIsDefaultInstanceProvider and repositoryProviderName.

    Using the first one, the repository can be enabled/disabled as the
    default provider for instance (and association) operations.  The default
    setting is "true", so the default behavior has not been changed.  To
    disable the repository as the default instance provider, issue the
    following command before starting cimserver:

        cimconfig -s repositoryIsDefaultInstanceProvider=false -p

    The repositoryProviderName configuration property specifies what
    provider name is used to explicitly register the repository as a
    provider.  This is necessary when the repository needs to serve
    instances of a class and repositoryIsDefaultInstanceProvider is set
    to "false".  The default value is "repository".  To register the
    repository as an instance provider for a class, add a
    'Provider("repository")' qualifier to the class definition.

51. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 26 Nov 2001 - Added a new ServiceCIMOMHandle to
    pass to providers that act as services.  This handle provides
    service providers with access to the CIMServer data structures.

52. (Roger Kumpf - HP) 28 Nov 2001 - Implemented ModifyInstance in
    the repository so that it respects the IncludeQualifiers and
    PropertyList parameters.  Updated SetProperty in the repository
    so that it uses ModifyInstance correctly.  The repository now
    supports GetProperty and SetProperty in addition to ModifyInstance.

    Implemented GetProperty and SetProperty in the Dispatcher and
    Provider2 so that they get translated to GetInstance and
    ModifyInstance calls (respectively) in the provider.  Providers
    written to the Provider2 API that correctly process the new
    ModifyInstance parameters will automatically support SetProperty
    operations.  Note that GetProperty and SetProperty currently only
    work for String properties because of an XML encoding limitation.

53. (Nag Boranna - HP, Sushma Fernandes - HP) 30 Nov 2001 - Implemented the
    Security components for authentication and authorization. 

    Authentication and User Management:
    cimuser CLI : This CLI is used for addition, modification, removal
    and listing of CIM Users. The CIM user password is encrypted and stored
    in a file. The password file format is compatible with Apache's htpasswd 
    generated password file. 

    cimauth CLI implement the authorization managment functionality by letting
    to add/remove/list user authorizations.
    
    User Manager and  User Manager Provider  components implement the user 
    management and authorization functionality.   

54. (Mike Brasher - BMC) 3 Dec 2001 - Added support for WQL-1. New directory
    under src/Pegasus/WQL which contains library and BNF.

55. (Yi Zhou - HP) 03 Dec 2001 - Implemented Pegasus registration provider
    which does provider registration, block, unblock, and stop a provider.
    It also alert Subscription Service of any provider registration changes.

56. (Rudy Schuet - Compaq) 04 Dec 2001 - Replaced _min macro in String.h
    and String.cpp with PEG_min. The _min macro caused problems on the
    NSK platform because of a duplicate definition in a standard file.
  
57. (Carol Ann Krug Graves - HP) 04 Dec 2001 - Implemented Pegasus indication
    subscription service provider that serves as the instance provider for the 
    CIM_IndicationSubscription, CIM_IndicationFilter and CIM_IndicationHandler 
    classes (from CIM_Events27.mof).  The service also takes appropriate action
    in response to startup, shutdown of the cimom, termination of a provider, 
    or change in provider registration.  

58. (Jenny Yu - HP) 05 Dec 2001 - Implemented Pegasus Shutdown Service
    and the command line interface for shutting down cimom gracefully.
    For more information, refer to the CIMOM Shutdown working paper 
    in pegasus/doc/WorkPapers/CIMOMShutdown.pdf.

59. (Markus Mueller - IBM) 06 Dec 2001 - Implemented SSL support (Linux only).
    It consists the new classes SSL_Context, SSLSocket and MP_Socket defined
    in TLS.h. HTTPAcceptor and HTTPConnector are extended with an additional
    constructor to set a pointer to the server-, resp. client wide SSL_Context
    structure. The Socket field in HTTPConnection is substituted with an
    MP_Socket pointer, a class that is designed to hide the differences
    between Socket and SSLSocket. The MP_Socket (multipurpose socket) class
    is defined even in a non-ssl environment.
    How to use it in a Server or Client:
    1. Just create an SSL_Context once per Server/Client address space
    2. Construct every HTTPConnector/Acceptor with a pointer to this
       SSL_Context if you want to enable SSL; construct Connectors/Acceptors
       without SSL_Context for conventional connections.

    The Configuration data was extended with the boolean SSL property, and
    cimserver and TestClient now understand the -SSL, resp. -ssl flag.

60. (Bapu Patil - HP) Updated makefiles to support HP-UX IA64 bits O.S.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1 - July 2001 Development branch
              Tagged as version_1_01 on 3 August 2001 (sorry should have been
              1.1

1. (Nitin Upasani - HP) Implementation of handleIndication() to deliver
   indication by defining IndicationDispatcher, HandlerTable, CIMHandler
   and ExportClient classes. the indication.

   Also implemented CIMxmlIndicationHandler and sendmailIndicationHandler to
   make the delivery of indications over Xml-HTTP and email respectively.

   Provided examples for HandlerTable, XmlIndicationDelivery and
   SendMailIndicationDelivery to support this implementation.

2. (Markus Mueller - IBM) Implementation of a Linux specific threading
   library and a thread-safe message queue (first stage). Classes defined
   are Mutex, Condition, Semaphore, AtomicInt, ReadWriteSem, cleanup_handler
   and SimpleThread.

3. (Carol Ann Krug Graves - HP)  Implementation of wbemexec CLI.  Please refer
   to the man page in pegasus/src/Clients/wbemexec/doc/wbemexec.html for more
   information on using wbemexec.  A simple test script is included.  Please
   see pegasus/src/Clients/wbemexec/tests/readme for information on running
   the test script.

4. (Sushma Fernandes - HP)  Implementation of Trace Framework.  Please
   refer to the documentation in src/Pegasus/Common/doc/TracingDevGuide.pdf
   and
   src/Pegasus/Common/doc/TracingUserGuide.pdf for more information on using
   the Trace framework. Classes defined are src/Pegasus/Common/Tracer.cpp and
   src/Pegasus/Common/TraceFileHandler.cpp.

5. (Nag Boranna - HP)  Implementation of Config Framework, Config Provider and
   Config CLI. Please refer to the documentation
   in pegasus/doc/WorkPapers/CIMOMConfigurationWorkPaper.pdf and the man page
   in pegasus/src/Clients/cimconfig/doc/cimconfig.html for more information on
   using the config framework and cimconfig CLI. Make sure to load the config
   mof (src/gmake config) before starting the cimserver. A simple test script
   is included. Please see pegasus/src/Clients/wbemexec/tests/readme for
   information on running the test script.

6. (Karl Schopmeyer 31 July 2001) - Add toMof functions to the CIM objects
   (changed the H and CPP files for the major CIM objects. These
   functions generate CIM MOF output for the objects.

7. (Bapu Patil - HP)  Implementation of Local Channel Authentication. Local
   Authentication provides security mechanism to authenticates CIM clients
   that
   connect to CIM Server on the same system without having to specify a
   password.
   Please refer to "doc/LocalCIMSecurity.pdf" for more information on design.
   This component only works on unix and it's not linked in with the main
   build.
   When authentication framework is defined this component may need to be
   modified to integrate with the framework.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.99.x (Fixes to version 0.99) in Process

Version 0.97.4 - Tag Created for 0.97.4 and snapshot 7 July 2001

1. Deamonizaiton added to CIMServer.cpp by Mike Day.  This includes code bothe
for NT and Linux platforms.

2. KS Changed the namespace cimv20 to cimv2 and the default port from 888 to
5988.
NOTE: 5988 is now the officially recognized preferred port for a CIMServer by
the DMTF.

3. KS Corrected some errors found in interoperability testing during the DMTF
Fusion event.  THis included a) extended the test for end of HTTP header from
CR/LF/CR/LF to also allow LF/LF.  Not strictly legal but widely used. b).
Extended the HTTP message ID to allow for non-numeric message IDs.

4. Broke out RepositoryDeclContext class from Repository/CIMRepository.cpp
and created RepositoryDeclContext.{cpp,h}.  This is the first step in
revamping the compiler to work independently of the repository (grb).

5. Created new makefile Compiler/Makefile.grammar and modified
Compiler/Makefile; and added cimmof_tab.{cpp,h} and cimmof_lex.cpp.
Now when you build normally, you will get the committed grammar and parser
files instead of generating your own for a particular platform.  This should
prevent back-level lex and yacc implementations from generating troublesome
code.  The committed files are generated from flex 2.5.4 and bison 1,28.
(grb)

6.  Added Compiler/compilerDeclContext.{cpp,h} and makefile changes.
This change paves the way for upcoming changes that will allow the compiler
to work indepently of the repository. (grb)

7. Extend testclient (clients/testclient) tests and functions. ks 19 June 2001

8. CV added const to CIMOperations modifyInstance, createInstance,
modifyClass,
createClass to protect caller's object.

9. CV added CIMQueryProvider and CIMAssociationProvider to the Provider2
directory. These
interfaces allow very smart providers to perform advances operations.
CIMProviderStub has
been updated to support the new interfaces. Needs testing.

10. Added rpm packaging support and shell script based build process. MM

11. Changed Make so make tests no longer rebuilds repository.  To rebuild
repository you make world, make rebuild or make repository. ks

12. Added associators() and associatorNames() operations to CIM repository.
    (MEB)

13. More on association implementation (all four operations supported).
    Need to handle deletion of associations and protocol stubs still.
    Need to test class associations (rather than just instance associations).
    Need to handle deleteInstance().
    (MEB)

14. slp client code integrated as pegasus-style c++ library. (MDD)

15. (Karl)Update CGI Client to correct number of errors and install
AssociationName
and ReferenceName functions.  This included extensive update to the HTML
pages.

16. (Denise E.) Changes to slp client support code for HPUX (

17. (Markus Mueller) Additional changes to support dynamic libraries. Fixed
ProviderTable tests. Fixed build process (slp with PEGASUS_SUPPORTS_DYNLIB).
Made cimserver accept the -D flag to eliminate the need for environment
variables.

18. (Mike Brasher) Added support for Associators(), AssociatorNames(),
    References() and ReferenceNames() CIM operations. These only operate
    on instances at this time. They will operate on classes soon.

19. (Mike Glantz) Extended and modified dynamic support
    changes to (1) work on HP-UX and (2) have all images and libraries
    buildable per the value of PEGASUS_SUPPORTS_DYNLIB. The biggest
    change is to program.mak and library-unix.mak, removing specific
    lists of dynamic library specs and putting them in the Makefile
    and libraries.mak files that build the actual targets (lots of
    these now have DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES defined).

20. (Karl) added basic Queue function to common (based on array) and added
    tests for stack and queue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.97.3 - Released 5 June 2001

1. (KS)OptionManager (CPP and H), Logger (CPP and H), Handler (CPP and H),
CIMServer (both)
Functions added include:
	a. Enable trace to log file.
	b. Add option so that you can trace to console or trace to logfile (-l
	is
	   trace to log, -t is trace to console).
	c. add parameter in optionsrow for help message and enable the capture
	   of these messages in Options class.  Also added help print that
	   prints these things out.  However, format not to beautiful.
	d. Eliminate a couple of messages coming from __Namespace provider.
	e. Extend the Clients\testclient so he does tests on Namespace.
2. (KS)Extended Log to show time, severity.

3. (KS)Added getCurrentASCIITime functions to System.x

4. (KS)Extended options on CIMServer including 1. option to determine where
logs
are put

5. (KS)Added TestClient that executes a series of tests against a server.
This is a preliminary version.

6. (KS)Corrected problem with acceptor.bind where failure was being lost. Now
throws CannotBind exception.

7. (KS)Added logger entry to XMLParser for errors.  NOTE: At this point it may
not
print out all of the message.  At the least it prints out the error message
and components of the message causing the problem.

8. (KS)Added clean option to server but temprarily disabled.

9. (KS)Fixed problem where logs were not created unless logs directory already
existed.

10. (Mike Brasher) Added "Test" prefix to all test program names.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
Version 0.97.2

1. Extend HP UX port to correctly load Dynamic Load Libraries.
2. Extend Formatter for Boolean and Uint32 types.
3. Change CIM Server to use Trace (-t) flag.  This also changed
   Handler.h to work off of flag.
4. Minor corrections to __Namespace Provider.
5. Extend tests for Formatter, String, and other modules.
6. Correct errors in documentation.
7. New working papers (provider interface).
8. Add Providerreg.exe tool.
9. Add trace output for messages sent from the Server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--

23 May 2001 Version 0.97.1 Tags as version_0_971

1. Add PEG_NOT_FOUND symbol to replace Uint32(-1) in any of the object
find functions.  Note: This symbol is defined in config.h. (ks).

2. Port To HP UX.  This required a number of changes particularly in the area
of dynamic lib loaading.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--

21 May 2001  Version 0.97 - Tagged as version_0_97

1. Added methods in CIMClass, CIMInstance, for existance of properties,
qualifiers, methods.
2. Add methods in CIMClass, CIMInstance to remove properties, qualifier,
methods.
3. Added CIMmethod and CIMProperty in CIMMethod to text for existance of
qualifiers and to
remove qualifiers.
4. Ported to AIX. NOTE: This port was done using an earlier version of the AIX
compiler.  It probably imposed more limitations than would be required with
the current compiler.  This version of the port produces an excessively large
common module due to template bloat.  That problem will be fixed in a future
change to the port. Also there are a log of duplicate symbol warnings generate
by the AIC compiler but these cause no problems.  The port has been tested
with the complete unit test and client/server test successfully.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

23 May 2001

1.  Ported to HPUX

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

29 May 2001

1.  Implemented CIMRepository::setProperty() and CIMRepository::getProperty().
