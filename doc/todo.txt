    -	Implement consistency and constraint checking on classes and instances.

    -   Implement filtering (using includeQualifiers, localOnly, etc.)

    -	Consider eliminating const CIM element classes.

    -   Support for NULL property lists (in interface and protocol).

    -   Rename tests (prepend "Test" to each test).

    -   Fix bug with cimserver.exe causing it to fail to start without te
	"-l" option.

    -   Resolve whether the backslash should be permitted in namespaces.

    -   Create CIMOMContext (interface to CIMOM used b the provider).

    -	Define Encoding module interface.

    - 	Develop XMLEncodings module.

    - 	Develop BinaryEncodings module.

    - 	Develop MOFEncodings module.

    -	Employ BinaryEncodings module in repository (reduce disk usage).

    -   Combine repository instances, classes, and qualifiers  into their
	respective files (to reduce the number of files).

    -	Employ an efficient indexing scheme in repository (B-trees or hashing).

    -	Develop module manager: interface, lookup scheme, and loading scheme.

    -   Package Encodings classes as a module.

    -   Finalize repository assocations.

    -   Add association CIM/HTTP operations.

    -   Design association provider infrastructure.

    -	Implement missing CIM protocol operations.

    -   Implement good observer module interface which allows different levels:

	-   Observation of client/CIMMOM connections/disconnection.

	-   Observation of client/CIMOM communication.

	-   Observation of CIMOM/repository communication.

	-   Observation of CIMOM/provider communication.

	-   Observation of CIMOM state transitions.

    -	Pegasus providers for Sun WBEM Services.

    -	Pegasus providers for WMI.

    -	Sun WBEM Services providers for Pegasus.

    -   CIM/HTTP Proxy for WMI.

    -   Web Server/Pegasus Integration (use HTTP protocol capabilities of
	web server rather than Pegasus).

    -   Add CIMRepository::namespaceExists() method.

    - 	Change HTTP message id's to this format: "YYYY.MM.DD.HH.MM.SS.NNNNN".

    - 	GetInstances() and GetClasses() need to use iterators on
	provider and repository end. Otherwise, all classes or instance
	to be enumerated, must be sucked into memory.

    -   Template bloat reduction.

    - 	Need a tool to say which features are supported by a compiler.

    -   Support unloading of dynamic libraries (presently only load() is
	supported).

    -	Clean up and consolidate exception classes.

    -	Asynchronous socket writes in the CIMOM (need write enabled flags).

    -	Handle PARAMETER.REFARRAY in Procotol?

    -	Implemented stream oriented XML parsing.

    -	Ignore extraneous XML elements (implement "loose validation" concept).

    -	Add methods to get objects by their names, in addition to index. For
	example:

	    CIMProperty CIMClass::getProperty(const String& name);

    -	Distinguish between private and public classes (otherwise, users may
	come to depend on classes with unstable interfaces).

    -	Walk through all code to expose consistency/aesthetic issues.

    -	Provide ACE Channel implementation (for porting purposes)?

    -	Expand datatime (setCurrentTime() and comparison and increment 
	functions).

    -	Write Pegasus Architecture Paper.

    -	Implement MOF provider registration scheme (according to the
	standard).

    -	WBEM Query Language and integration.

    -   Threading

    -	Package up pegasus in Install Shield application.

    -	Internationalization: Handle UCS2 characters in XML 
	(parsing and writing).

    -	Export of repository to MOF.

    -   Change CompareNoCase() to String::compareNoCase().

    -	Figure out how to handle CIM NULL values.

    -	Figure out how inheritance of keys works.

    -	Investiage weak assocations.

    -	Enforce constraint qualifiers.

    -	Disallow resetting size of fixed length arrays.

    -	Shrink object sizes.

    -	Use lighter I/O system (than C++ streams).

    -	Run Purify on all sources (port to Sun first).

    -	Optimize clear method on arrays (to not release memory).

    -	Provide conversions between DateTime and time_t.

    -	Port to Solaris

    -   Support multiple providers of the extact same class.
	DiskController example and LanController.

    -   SLP
	    - Eliminate lib directory.
