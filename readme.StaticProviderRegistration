                        Static Provider Registration
                        ============================


SYNOPSIS:
=========

This document explains how to register static providers using the
EmbeddedServer class. An example of this is included under:

    pegasus/vxworks/cimserver/MyEmbeddedServer.cpp

PREPARING THE STATIC PROVIDER MODULE
====================================

The only requirement of the provider is that it include the 
"PegasusCreateProvider" entry point. This is standard for Pegasus C++
providers and CIMPLE providers include this entry point when module.cpp
is compiled with the following option:

    -DCIMPLE_PEGASUS_MODULE

Caution: Do not rename this entry point as was required in a previous version
of the static provider mechanism.

There may be at most one PegasusCreateProvider entry point in the entire
server.

STATICALLY REGISTERING THE PROVIDER
===================================

To statically register the provider, first register the PegasusCreateProvider
entry point by overriding EmbeddedServer::initialize() and adding the following
code fragment (see pegasus/vxworks/cimserver/MyEmbeddedServer.cpp for an
example).

    if (!registerPegasusCreateProviderEntryPoint(PegasusCreateProvider))
    {
        /* Error */
    }

Next, register each provider with the following fragment (replacing CLASSNAME
with the name of that provider's class).

    if (!registerProvider(
        nameSpaces,
        CLASSNAME,
        MyEmbeddedServer::PEGASUS_PROVIDER_INTERFACE,
        MyEmbeddedServer::INSTANCE_PROVIDER_TYPE))
    {
        /* Error */
    }
