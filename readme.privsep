Using Pegasus Privilege Separation Functionality

Privilege separation was added to Pegasus starting with Pegasus 2.7.  This
is a security feature. It allows separation of the functionality so that
only a minimal set of code runs as a privileged user (ex. root) in a
separate process (the executor).  The majority of pegasus runs as a
nonprivileged user (the cim server).  The CIM Server makes requests on the
executor for functions that require root privilege.

The privilege separation functionality is documented in PEP 286.

cimserver is the executor program (see src/Executor).
cimservermain is the server program (see src/Server and
src/Pegasus/Common/Executor.h).

Privilege separation is build-time optional functionality. To enable privilege
separation, define the following environment variable before compiling.

    PEGASUS_ENABLE_PRIVILEGE_SEPARATION=true

If this build variable is not set, the cimserver runs as the user under which
it was started and all privelege separation functionality is disabled.

The nonprivileged user for privilege separation is the user under which the
cimservermain component executes.  The name of this user is specified by the
PEGASUS_CIMSERVERMAIN_USER macro, whose default value is defined in
Constants.h.  The specified user MUST exist or cimserver will terminate
immediately.
