Building Pegasus on NT or Windows 2000 and Windows 98
======================================================

    1.  Obtain GNU MAKE.EXE and MU.EXE and put them on your path.

    2.  Obtain and install ACE Wrappers.

    3.	Run the VCVARS32.BAT file supplied with Microsoft Visual C++
	(it is contained in the same directory as cl.exe).

    4.	Define the PEGASUS_ACE_ROOT environment variable. For example:

	    C:\> set PEGASUS_ACE_ROOT=c:\ACE_wrappers

	Add %PEGASUS_ACE_ROOT%\bin to your path.

    5.  Unpack the PEGASUS distribution zip file. Put the "pegasus\build\bin"
        directory on our path. For example:

	    C:\> set path=%path%;c:\pegasus\build\bin

    6.  Change directory to the root of the Pegasus distribution and
        type "make world" to build Pegasus and to run its tests.
